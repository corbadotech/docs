## Overview

Corbado provides two different APIs with distinct authentication methods:

1. **Frontend API**: Uses session-based authentication
2. **Backend API**: Uses HTTP Basic Authentication

## Frontend API Authentication

The Frontend API uses session-based authentication. As a developer, you don't need to handle the authentication details manually as they are automatically managed by our [UI Components](/corbado-complete/ui-components/overview). The session management, token handling, and security measures are all built into our components.

## Backend API Authentication

The Backend API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. You need to provide your Project ID and API Secret in the Authorization header of each request.

### Getting Started

To get started with the Backend API, you'll need to obtain your API credentials:

1. Go to [API Secrets](https://app.corbado.com/settings/api-secrets) in your Corbado dashboard
2. Create a new API secret or use an existing one
3. Keep your Project ID and API Secret secure - they provide full access to your Corbado account

### Authentication Header Format

```http
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
```

Where `<base64-encoded-credentials>` is the Base64 encoding of `projectID:apiSecret`.

### Example Request

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://backendapi.corbado.io/v2/socialAccounts \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>'
```

### Security Best Practices

- Never expose your API Secret in client-side code
- Never commit your API Secret to your source code management system (SCM)
- Use professional secret management solutions (e.g., [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/))
- Rotate your API Secret regularly
- Use HTTPS for all API requests

## Error Handling

If authentication fails, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response. Common authentication errors include:

- Invalid API credentials
- Expired session tokens
- Missing authentication headers
- Malformed authentication headers

For more details about error handling, see our [Error Types](/api-reference/error-types) documentation.
