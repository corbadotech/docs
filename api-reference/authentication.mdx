## Overview

Corbado provides two different APIs with distinct authentication methods:

1. **Backend API**: Uses HTTP Basic Authentication
2. **Frontend API**: Uses session-based authentication

## Getting Started

### API Keys

To get started with Corbado's APIs, you'll need to obtain your API credentials:

1. Go to [API Secrets](https://app.corbado.com/settings/api-secrets) in your Corbado dashboard
2. Create a new API secret or use an existing one
3. Keep your Project ID and API Secret secure - they provide full access to your Corbado account

## Backend API Authentication

The Backend API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. You need to provide your Project ID and API Secret in the Authorization header of each request.

### Authentication Header Format

```http
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
```

Where `<base64-encoded-credentials>` is the Base64 encoding of `projectID:apiSecret`.

### Example Request

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://backendapi.corbado.io/v2/socialAccounts \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic <encoded-value>'
```

### Security Best Practices

- Never expose your API Secret in client-side code
- Store your API Secret securely in environment variables
- Rotate your API Secret regularly
- Use HTTPS for all API requests

## Frontend API Authentication

The Frontend API uses session-based authentication. After a user successfully logs in, they receive a session token that must be included in subsequent API requests.

### Authentication Header Format

```http
Authorization: Bearer <session-token>
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://{projectId}.frontendapi.corbado.io/v2/me \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <session-token>'
```

### Security Best Practices

- Always use HTTPS
- Implement proper session management
- Set appropriate session timeouts
- Handle token refresh when needed

## Error Handling

If authentication fails, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response. Common authentication errors include:

- Invalid API credentials
- Expired session tokens
- Missing authentication headers
- Malformed authentication headers
