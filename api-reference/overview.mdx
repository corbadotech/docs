Corbado provides two main API interfaces for integrating authentication into your application: the Corbado Frontend API and the Corbado Backend API.

# Corbado Frontend API

The Corbado Frontend API is designed for client-side integration and provides endpoints for user authentication flows. It's the foundation of our UI components and handles processes such as signup, login, and session management.

# Corbado Backend API

The Corbado Backend API provides secure, server-side integration capabilities. It's designed for operations that require higher security and is used by both the Corbado Frontend API and your backend application.
