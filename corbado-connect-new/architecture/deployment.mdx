# TODOS

- Add Scalability & performance
  - Backend written in high-performance Go
  - Handles hundreds of authentcation transactions per second
  - Prooven with load testing using k6
  - Link to k6 passkey extension
  - Auto-scaling in cloud provider based on CPU and Memory consumption
- Add break-glass user
- Add Escrow
- Check "private cloud", is that the correct term?

# Corbado Deployment Options

When deploying the **Corbado Connect** solution, you have two primary hosting models to choose from - our **public cloud** or a **private cloud **(**dedicated AWS) instance**. Each model offers different levels of customization, security and availability, depending on your organization's requirements. Within the private cloud model, there are multiple high-availability configurations to handle different disaster scenarios.

## Public Cloud (Shared Instance)

For organizations aiming for simplicity and speed, Corbado offers a **public cloud instance** hosted on shared AWS infrastructure. This is a cost-effective, fully managed environment where Corbado handles all maintenance, security updates, and scaling.

- **Quick Setup**: Ideal for businesses that want a frictionless path to go live.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Shared infrastructure lowers operational costs.
- **Scalability**: Automatically adapts to user demand, ensuring smooth performance.

If your focus is on rapid deployment without extensive customization or regulatory constraints, the public cloud instance is an excellent fit.

## Private Cloud (Dedicated AWS Instance)

For organizations requiring tighter controls or more advanced compliance measures, Corbado can be deployed in a private cloud (dedicated AWS instance). This deployment model provides full control over data residency, customized security policies, and network configuration. Within a private cloud setup, you can choose from three levels of high availability and disaster recovery:

### 1. Multi-AZ Single-Region (Standard)

- **Description**: Runs in multiple Availability Zones (AZ) within a single AWS region.
- **Infrastructure**:
  - Application workload runs in 3 of 3 AZs.
  - Database workload runs in 2 of 3 AZs (MySQL RDS Multi-AZ).
- **Resiliency**:
  - Automatically handles the failure of a single AZ (with near-zero data loss).
  - If two out of three AZs fail, service may degrade until AWS stabilizes in the remaining AZ.
  - Complete regional failure requires manual failover or data restore (4â€“8 hours RTO, up to 24 hours RPO).

### 2. Multi-AZ \+ Cross-Region Replica

- **Description**: Extends Multi-AZ by adding near real-time data replication to a secondary AWS region.
- **Infrastructure**:
  - Primary environment identical to Multi-AZ Single-Region.
  - Replicated data in another AWS region (\< 1 minute RPO).
- **Resiliency**:
  - If two AZs fail or the entire primary region is impacted, you have a current copy of data in another region.
  - Failover is still manual, but downtime is shorter (1-4 hours RTO, \< 1 minute RPO).

### 3. Geo Failover-Ready

- **Description**: Maintains a secondary region with both replicated data and a partially deployed (cold) application environment.
- **Infrastructure**:
  - Near real-time data replication to secondary region (\< 1 minute RPO).
  - Secondary environment can be activated quickly with minimal manual intervention (push button).
- **Resiliency**:
  - Ideal for organizations that demand the highest availability.
  - In the event of a complete regional outage, recovery can occur within 15-30 minutes (RTO), with \< 1 minute RPO.

## Fallback Mechanism for Passkeys

Corbado's system architecture ensures that any disruption to the passkey component automatically falls back to traditional login methods (e.g., existing login methods). This means:

- **Minimal Impact**: Only passkey functionality is affected if a component fails.
- **Continuous Checkout**: Payment or other workflows continue without interruption.
- **Seamless Recovery**: Once the passkey service is restored, users can go right back to biometric authentication.

## Comparing RTO & RPO Across Deployment Configurations

The following table provides a high-level comparison of Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) for different failure scenarios across the dedicated AWS configurations.

| **Failure Event**          | **Multi-AZ Single-Region**                          | **Cross-Region Replica**                                 | **Geo Failover**                                      |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single AZ Failure**      | RTO: 1-5 min  RPO: ~0 min                           | No need to fail over                                     | No need to fail over                                  |
| **Two AZ Failure**         | RTO: 15-30 min  RPO: ~0 min  _Until AWS stabilizes_ | RTO: 1-4 h  RPO: \< 1 min  _Manual failover if required_ | RTO: 15-30 min  RPO: \< 1 min  _Push-button failover_ |
| **Primary Region Failure** | RTO: 4-8 h  RPO: up to 24 h  _Manual failover_      | RTO: 1-4 h  RPO: \< 1 min  _Manual failover_             | RTO: 15-30 min  RPO: \< 1 min  _Push-button failover_ |

## Next Steps

1. **Evaluate Your Requirements**: Determine whether a shared or dedicated environment best meets your security, compliance, and performance needs.
2. **Choose a High-Availability Tier** (if you select the dedicated AWS option): Decide which resiliency model (Multi-AZ Single-Region, Multi-AZ \+ Cross-Region Replica, or Geo Failover-Ready) aligns with your risk tolerance and recovery objectives.
