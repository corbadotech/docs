# Approaches

When integrating passkeys into your application, you generally have two main options for how users will log in with their passkeys:

1. **Automatic Login (Identifier-First) Approach**  
2. **Separate Passkey Button Approach**

Corbado Connect supports and enhances both methods. Choosing the right approach is a crucial decision because it directly impacts your passkey adoption rate and user experience.


## Why the Approach Matters

### User Experience
A smooth, intuitive flow maximizes passkey adoption. Both the "automatic" and "button" methods can be optimized to deliver a frictionless experience, but each requires a different setup.

### Security & Account Enumeration
Some organizations prefer to minimize any chance of unintentionally revealing user identifiers ("account enumeration"). Others prioritize swift passkey logins without manual button clicks.

### Adoption Goals
Are you looking to drive the highest possible passkey usage quickly, or do you need a transitional, less disruptive approach?

#### How Corbado Connect Helps
- **Passkey Intelligence**: Our engine intelligently detects if a device is likely to have a valid passkey, selectively prompting users to avoid confusion or false starts.  
- **One-Tap Passkey Buttons**: A streamlined login button that appears automatically for users with an existing passkey—offering "one-tap" biometric login without requiring them to re-enter their username.

| **Automatic Login (Identifier-First)** | - **High Adoption**: Automatically prompting for passkeys when users enter their identifier can yield 50–80% passkey usage. <br/> - **Seamless UX**: Reduced steps for users who already have passkeys. <br/> - **Strong Security**: Passkeys replace vulnerable credentials and reduce phishing.           | - **Passkey Intelligence**: Corbado Connect analyzes device/browser signals & user history to auto-trigger passkey login only when it's likely to succeed—avoiding dead-end prompts. <br/> - **Smart Fallback**: If a passkey is absent, Corbado Connect gracefully reverts to alternate methods without confusing users. |
| **Separate Passkey Button**      | - **Easy to Implement**: Minimal changes to existing login forms—just add a dedicated "Sign in with Passkey" button. <br/> - **Reduced Enumeration Risk**: Users can start with a passkey flow without revealing their username first. <br/> - **Gradual Adoption**: Easier transition for existing user bases. | - **One-Tap Passkey Button**: The passkey button "remembers" returning passkey users, enabling a single tap to launch the passkey prompt. <br/> - **Passkey Intelligence**: Detects when users might have a passkey but haven't clicked the button, nudging them gently to adopt passkeys.          |


## Choosing the Best Approach for Your Organization

- If you want **maximum passkey usage** and don't mind the extra logic for fallback handling, **Automatic Login** with Corbado's Passkey Intelligence typically drives higher adoption.
- If you prefer a **more conservative rollout** or have strict account-enumeration constraints, the **Separate Passkey Button** approach is simpler while still delivering a seamless passkey experience when combined with our One-Tap feature.

Regardless of which method you choose, Corbado Connect ensures that users with existing passkeys are gently guided toward a frictionless, biometric sign-in—raising your passkey login rate and gradually reducing reliance on passwords or OTPs.
