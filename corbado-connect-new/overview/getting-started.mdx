**Corbado Connect** is a powerful, passkey-first authentication solution for enterprises. As its setup involves several important decisions to tailor it to your specific needs, it is not a self-service product. To help you understand its features and benefits, we have created a comprehensive demo application.

TODO hört sich noch nicht geil an drüber, besonders das mit self-service.

## Explore the Demo

Our demo showcases the core functionalities of **Corbado Connect**, allowing you to experience the seamless and secure user journeys it enables.

The demo highlights the most critical flows, such as:

-   **[Sign-up](/corbado-connect-new/flows/user-sign-up):** See how new users can easily create an account, with passkey creation integrated into the flow.
-   **[Login](/corbado-connect-new/flows/user-login):** Experience the convenience of logging in with a passkey, eliminating the need for traditional passwords.

## Technical Details

The demo application is built with a modern tech stack to illustrate how Corbado Connect can be integrated into your own environment. The key components are:

-   **Frontend/Backend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
-   **Identity Provider:** [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/)
