Corbado Connect is a powerful, passkey-first authentication solution for enterprises. As its setup involves several important decisions to tailor it to your specific needs, it is not a self-service product. To help you understand its features and benefits, we have created a comprehensive demo application.

## Explore the Demo

Our demo showcases the core functionalities of Corbado Connect, allowing you to experience the seamless and secure user journeys it enables.

The demo covers the following:

-   **Sign-up:** See how new users can easily create an account, with passkey creation integrated into the flow.
-   **Passkey Login:** Experience the convenience of logging in with a passkey, eliminating the need for traditional passwords.
-   **Profile Management:** Understand how users can manage their passkeys and other security settings from their profile page.

## Technical Details

The demo application is built with a modern tech stack to illustrate how Corbado Connect can be integrated into your own environment. The key components are:

-   **Frontend/Backend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
-   **Identity Provider:** [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/)

For a deeper understanding of the integration, including sequence charts, please refer to our [Amazon Cognito](/corbado-connect-new/integration/cognito) integration guide.
