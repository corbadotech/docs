## Introduction

**Corbado Connect** allows you to seamlessly integrate passkey-first authentication into your existing Amazon Cognito user pools. This enables you to offer your users a secure and convenient login experience without passwords, while still leveraging the power of Cognito for user management.

This guide will walk you through the process of integrating **Corbado Connect** with Amazon Cognito, using a sample Next.js application to demonstrate the key concepts.

Amazon Cognito is a service that provides authentication, authorization, and user management for your web and mobile apps. You can learn more about it on the [official Amazon Cognito website](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/).

## How it Works

The integration between **Corbado Connect** and Amazon Cognito leverages a powerful feature known as a **Custom Authentication Flow**. This feature allows developers to create their own challenge-and-response models using AWS Lambda functions, which is ideal for integrating external authentication mechanisms like Corbado's passkey-first solution.

Instead of a traditional username and password, we will define a custom flow that uses a passkey signature as the challenge.

To implement this, we need to configure the Cognito User Pool to use three specific AWS Lambda triggers:

- **`DefineAuthChallenge`**: This Lambda acts as the orchestrator of our custom flow. It determines which challenge to present to the user at each step of the authentication process.
- **`CreateAuthChallenge`**: This Lambda is responsible for creating the challenge itself. In our case, it won't be creating a secret, but rather preparing for the verification that happens in the next step.
- **`VerifyAuthChallengeResponse`**: This is where the core verification logic resides. This Lambda takes the signed passkey data from the frontend (provided by **Corbado Connect**), and verifies it against Corbado's Backend API to confirm the user's identity. If verification is successful, it informs Cognito to issue the session tokens.

Later in this guide, we will dive deep into the source code and configuration of each of these functions.

## Example Application

To best illustrate the integration, we will refer to a complete example application. This application is built with the following technologies:

- **Next.js**: A popular React framework for building server-rendered applications.
- **AWS Amplify**: A library that simplifies interacting with AWS services like Cognito from a frontend application.

We will walk through the implementation of two key user journeys, showing how **Corbado Connect** is integrated at each stage:
- **[User Sign-up](/corbado-connect-new/flows/user-sign-up)**
- **[User Login](/corbado-connect-new/flows/user-login)**

## User Sign-up

In our example application, the initial user sign-up is handled through a conventional method (e.g., email and password) managed by Amazon Cognito. Once the user has an account and is logged in, we offer them the option to add a passkey to their account for future passwordless logins. This process is often called "passkey append".

### Implementation Overview

After a successful sign-up and initial login, the user is navigated to a page where the `CorbadoConnectAppend` UI component is displayed. This component handles the entire passkey creation and association process.

The implementation relies on a client component that fetches a special token and then renders the `CorbadoConnectAppend` component.

### Obtaining the ConnectToken

Before rendering the component, we need a short-lived `connectToken` (see [here](/corbado-connect-new/ui-components/overview#3-connecttokens-ctk)) from Corbado's Backend API. This token authorizes the creation of a passkey for a specific, authenticated user.

To get this token, the frontend first needs to get the `idToken` for the currently logged-in user from AWS Amplify. This JWT is proof of the user's session with Cognito.

```typescript
// In your frontend component:
import { fetchAuthSession } from 'aws-amplify/auth';
import { getCorbadoConnectTokenAppend } from './actions'; // Server Action

// ...
const session = await fetchAuthSession();
const idToken = session.tokens?.idToken?.toString();
const connectToken = await getCorbadoConnectTokenAppend(idToken);
// ...
```

The `idToken` is then sent to a Next.js Server Action, which securely handles the communication with Corbado's API. The server action first verifies the `idToken` to ensure it's valid and extracts the user's identity, then requests the `connectToken`.

```typescript /application/cognito/app/(auth-required)/post-login/actions.ts
'use server';

import {getCorbadoConnectToken, verifyAmplifyToken} from "@/lib/utils";

export async function getCorbadoConnectTokenAppend(idToken?: string) {
    if (!idToken) {
        throw new Error('idToken is required');
    }

    const {displayName, identifier} = await verifyAmplifyToken(idToken);

    return getCorbadoConnectToken('passkey-append', displayName, identifier);
}
```

### UI Component Integration

With the `appendTokenProvider` logic in place, we can now integrate the `CorbadoConnectAppend` component from the `@corbado/connect-react` library. The component takes care of the entire UI and logic for creating and storing the passkey.

Here's how it's used in our example application's `post-login` page:

```tsx /application/cognito/app/(auth-required)/post-login/page.tsx
'use client';

import {CorbadoConnectAppend} from "@corbado/connect-react";
import {useRouter} from "next/navigation";
import {getCorbadoConnectTokenAppend, postPasskeyAppend} from "@/app/(auth-required)/post-login/actions";
import {fetchAuthSession} from "aws-amplify/auth";
import {AppendStatus} from "@corbado/types";

export default function Page() {
    const router = useRouter();

    return (
        <div className="flex h-screen w-screen items-center justify-center bg-gray-50">
            <div className="z-10 w-full max-w-sm overflow-hidden rounded-2xl border border-gray-100 shadow-xl">
                <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4 bg-gray-50 px-4 py-8 sm:px-8">
                    <CorbadoConnectAppend
                        onSkip={async () => router.push('/profile')}
                        appendTokenProvider={async () => {
                            const session = await fetchAuthSession();
                            const idToken = session.tokens?.idToken?.toString();

                            return await getCorbadoConnectTokenAppend(idToken);
                        }}
                        onComplete={async (appendStatus: AppendStatus, clientState: string) => {
                            await postPasskeyAppend(appendStatus, clientState);
                            router.push('/profile');
                        }}
                    />
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

Key props:
- **`appendTokenProvider`**: A function that provides the ConnectToken we discussed earlier. It's called automatically by the component.
- **`onComplete`**: A callback that runs after the passkey has been successfully created. Here you can perform actions like updating your own backend or redirecting the user.
- **`onSkip`**: Allows the user to opt-out of creating a passkey at this time.

## User Login

- We need it to open a Cognito session or more precisely get Cognito tokens after successful authentication with Corbado Connect using a passkey

### Sequence chart

- Explain user login flow using a sequence chart
- Explain that the sequence chart starts AFTER successfull paykey authentication and thus focusses on the interaction between Cognito and Corbado Connect
- start with Amplify signIn, with it Cognito is going to execute define_auth_challenge and create_auth_challenge
- explain Amplify confirmSignIn, with it Cognito is going to execute verify_auth_challenge_respone
