## Introduction

Split testing (A/B testing) in **Corbado Connect** allows us to experiment with different feature configurations and user experience variations in a controlled manner. Unlike [Gradual Rollout](/corbado-connect-new/features/gradual-rollout) which controls feature availability, and [Passkey Intelligence](/corbado-connect-new/features/passkey-intelligence) which makes intelligent contextual decisions, split testing enables us to test the effectiveness of different approaches by randomly assigning users to different experimental groups.

## Why Split Tests?

Split testing is implemented in **Corbado Connect** for the following reasons:

- It needs to make consistent assignment decisions across multiple user sessions
- The assignments must be persistent and retrievable for the same user
- It operates independently of Passkey Intelligence's decision-making

## Split Decision Process

The split assignment decision is made during certain user interactions (e.g., login) using a rule-based system similar to [Passkey Intelligence](/corbado-connect-new/features/passkey-intelligence). The assignment combines:

- **User Context:** User ID, project ID, client information
- **Random Number:** Generated per user session to ensure randomness
- **Split Rules:** Configured rulesets that determine group assignment logic

## Persistence

Once a user is assigned to a split group, this assignment is permanently stored. This ensures consistency - a user will always be in the same experimental group across all their interactions.

## Auto-Append Example

We successfully used split testing to evaluate the "auto-append" feature, where we tested different strategies for automatically prompting users to create passkeys after login. This allowed us to measure the impact on user conversion rates and experience before rolling out the optimal approach.
