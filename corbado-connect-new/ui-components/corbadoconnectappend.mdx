**CorbadoConnectAppend** is used after a user has been authenticated (e.g., they've just logged in with a password or have an active session). Its role is to guide the user through creating (or "appending") a passkey to their account if the user and their device meet the eligibility requirements.
![CorbadoConnectAppend Component](https://www.corbado.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com%2Fcorbado-cloud-staging-website-assets%2FImage_11_03_25_at_13_34_9c883cf482.jpeg&w=750&q=75&dpl=dpl_B1BvxMgoZpGVDaa5gQri9YWwY9ju)

> **Important:** Only authenticated users are allowed to create new passkeys. You must generate a secure ConnectToken (see [here](/corbado-connect-new/ui-components/overview#3-connecttokens-ctk)) on your backend to validate that the user session is legitimate. This token is then passed to the component.

# Example

```js
<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.cloud.corbado.io/connect/dist/web-js-latest.min.js"></script>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.cloud.corbado.io/connect/dist/web-js-latest.min.css" />
  <script type="module">
    // This connect token must be generated on the server side
    // and passed to the component (e.g. by embedding it during server-side rendering).
    const connectAppendToken = 'ctk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx';

    const passkeyAppendElement = document.getElementById('passkey-append');
    Corbado.mountCorbadoConnectAppend(passkeyAppendElement, {
      projectId: "pro-9991871320976140999", // Your project's Corbado ID
      frontendApiUrlSuffix: "frontendapi.cloud.corbado.io", // Points to your chosen Corbado Frontend API environment

      // Called when the user decides not to create a passkey or passkey creation is skipped
      onSkip: (status) => { /* custom logic, e.g., logging or analytics */ },

      // Provide the connect token to the component at runtime
      appendTokenProvider: async () => connectAppendToken,

      // Called when passkey creation is completed successfully
      onComplete: (status, clientState) => { /* e.g., refresh page, show success UI, etc. */ },
    });
  </script>
</head>

<body>
  <!-- The passkey append UI will render into this div -->
  <div id="passkey-append"></div>
</body>
```

| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `onSkip`              | This function is called when the component skips the passkey append process. This happens for the following reasons: Gradual rollout does not allow the append  Passkey intelligence does not allow the append  The user actively skips the append       | ✅            | `(appendStatus: AppendStatus) => void`                      |
| `appendTokenProvider` | This function is called right after the component has finished its initial loading to retrieve an `appendToken`.                                                                                                                                         | ✅            | `() => Future<string>`                                      |
| `onComplete`          | This function is called when a passkey has been successfully appended to the user's account. It provides both the `appendStatus` and a `clientState` string, which can be stored on the client side (e.g., a cookie) to accelerate future passkey flows. | ✅            | `(appendStatus: AppendStatus, clientState: string) => void` |
