**CorbadoConnectPasskeyList** provides a user interface for users to view and manage their passkeys:

- **Listing Passkeys**: Displays passkeys linked to the user's account.
- **Deleting Passkeys**: Allows users to remove unneeded or compromised passkeys.
- **Passkey Creation**: Users can also add more passkeys from within this interface.

> **Note**: The implementation details for mounting callbacks and events align with those of `CorbadoConnectAppend` and `CorbadoConnectLogin`.
