## 1. Introduction

The Frontend API is designed for integration with your frontend / client-side of your application that cannot securely store secrets (e.g. native apps or single-page applications running entirely in the browser). It operates as the backbone of our pre-built UI components. If there is a need to enhance your registration or authentication procedures, then this API is intended for your use.

Our API adheres to a commonly recognized RESTful structure, which should make its usage fairly intuitive. However, should you require any assistance, you are always welcome to [contact us](https://www.corbado.com/contact).

## 2. Configuration

To call our Frontend API, you only need the Frontend API URL and the Corbado project ID which you can find in the [developer panel](https://app.corbado.com/app/settings/general).

All requests accept form-encoded request bodies, and respond with a JSON-encoded body.

<Note>
Your Frontend API can be accessed in the following format (default value):

**https://\<Project ID>.frontendapi.corbado.io**
