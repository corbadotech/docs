        caption="Native: iOS passkey login error states"

<Steps>
    <Step title="Passkey login aborted during OS prompt (first attempt)">
        - User begins the passkey login but cancels or dismisses the OS-native authentication prompt the first time.
        - The system allows the user to try logging in via passkeys or skip and continue with their current login method.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Passkey login aborted during OS prompt (subsequent attempts)">
        - After one or more cancellations in the operating systemâ€™s authentication prompt (e.g., second, third, or further attempts), the user continues to see the option to retry, but may receive a supportive message encouraging completion for improved security.
        - User can always opt to skip passkey login and proceed using traditional login credentials.
    </Step>
