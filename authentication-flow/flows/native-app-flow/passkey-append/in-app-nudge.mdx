## In-app Nudge to Create a Passkey

Use an in-app nudge to prompt users to add a passkey at a suitable moment in their native app session (e.g., after successful login or after a high-intent action). This helps transition users towards passwordless authentication without disrupting their flow.

<Steps>
    <Step title="App login via local biometric">
        - After the system local biometric authentication, user successfully logs in the native application.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Post-unlock: system initiates auto-append">
        - User is offered an option to create a passkey for future logins and continues with the process.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Passkey creation successful">
        - User successfully creates passkey and is now redirected to the app dashboard.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Post-unlock: show in-app nudge">
        - The In-app nudge can appear either directly after opening the app at some point or it can
        appear when the user skips/click outside the auto-append passkey OS prompt.

        - Choose a low-friction moment to display the nudge.

        - Present a concise message explaining the benefits of adding a passkey
        (faster, more secure logins) with a primary call-to-action and a clear
        skip option.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Begin passkey creation">
        - On accept, passkey creation initiates. User continues with the process.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Passkey creation successful">
        - User successfully authenticates via biometrics, creates a passkey and is now redirected to the app dashboard.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Handle decline or defer">
        - If the user skips, optionally schedule the
        nudge for a later session or a different context.
    </Step>
    <Step title="On CTA click: trigger in-app nudge">
        - When the user clicks any CTA on the app screen, prompts an in-app nudge.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Continue with in-app nudge">
        - The user interacts with the in-app nudge and either creates a passkey successfully or skips to continue to the dashboard.
    </Step>

</Steps>

<Tip>
    Keep the nudge short, avoid blocking flows, and offer a clear skip so users
    remain in control.
