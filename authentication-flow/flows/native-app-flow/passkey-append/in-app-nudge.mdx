## In-app Nudge to Create a Passkey

Use an in-app nudge to prompt users to add a passkey at a suitable moment in their native app session (e.g., after successful login or after a high-intent action). This helps transition users towards passwordless authentication without disrupting their flow.

        **3.a. OS-native biometric prompt appears**
        - OS biometric prompt modal appears asking the user to authenticate using fingerprint, face, or PIN for secure sign-in.
        - User successfully authenticates via biometrics.

        **3.b. Passkey creation successful**
        - User successfully creates passkey and is now redirected to the app dashboard.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Show in-app nudge">
        - The In-app nudge can appear either directly after opening the app at some point or it can
        appear when the user skips/click outside the auto-append passkey OS prompt.

        - Choose a low-friction moment to display the nudge.

        - Present a concise message explaining the benefits of adding a passkey
        (faster, more secure logins) with a primary call-to-action and a clear
        skip option.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Begin passkey creation">
        - On accept, passkey creation initiates.

        **5.a. OS-native biometric prompt appears**
        - OS biometric prompt modal appears asking the user to authenticate using fingerprint, face, or PIN for secure sign-in.
        - User successfully authenticates via biometrics.

        **5.b. Passkey creation successful**
        - User successfully creates passkey and is now redirected to the app dashboard.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Handle decline or defer">
        - If the user skips, optionally schedule the
        nudge for a later session or a different context.
    </Step>

</Steps>

<Tip>
    Keep the nudge short, avoid blocking flows, and offer a clear skip so users
    remain in control.
