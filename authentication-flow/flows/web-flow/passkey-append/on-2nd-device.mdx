title: "Passkey Append: On 2nd Device"
description: "This flow explains how users can append a passkey to their account after authenticating on a new device with a password. Passkey Intelligence detects the user has a passkey on their mobile device and offers cross-device authentication."

## Passkey Creation on Second Device

Users logging into a desktop or mobile web app from a new device follow a conventional login with password (and optionally conventional MFA) and are asked to create a new passkey on the current device.

<Info>
    NOTE: The grey background represents a mobile device linked to the
    user's account, used to complete biometric authentication via QR code scanning.
</Info>

<Warning>
    **Security Requirements:** Both devices must have **internet connectivity** and **Bluetooth enabled** for cross-device authentication to work. This dual-channel approach (QR code for initial pairing + Bluetooth proximity verification) is a critical phishing protection mechanism built into passkeys.
</Warning>

<Steps>
    <Step title="User enters identifier">
        - User enters their identifier (email/username) on the login page.
        - System now knows which user account is attempting to log in.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Fallback to traditional login method">
        - System detects no passkey created on the current device for this account, system falls back to traditional login method (username + password).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Passkey Intelligence detects mobile device passkey">
        - After successful password authentication, [Passkey Intelligence](/corbado-connect/features/passkey-intelligence) analyzes the user's passkey availability.
        - It automatically detects that this user has a passkey stored on their mobile device.
        - Based on this intelligence, the system prepares to offer cross-device authentication to append a passkey on the current device.
    </Step>
    <Step title="OS displays QR code screen">
        - The operating system displays a screen preparing the user for cross-device authentication.
        - The operating system generates a QR code for secure pairing.
        - **Requirements:** Both devices must have internet and Bluetooth enabled.
    </Step>
    <Step title="User scans QR and authenticates">
        - User scans the QR code using their mobile device where the passkey is stored.
        - **Bluetooth proximity check:** The OS verifies both devices are physically close (phishing protection).
        - The mobile device performs biometric or PIN authentication.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Login completes on current device & passkey append initiates">
        - Authentication response is securely sent back via the internet connection to complete login on the current device.
        - User is granted access on the current device.
        - After successful cross device authentication, user is asked to create a passkey on the current device.
    </Step>
    <Step title="OS-native biometric modal appears">
        - User chooses and continues to set up a passkey using fingerprint, face, or PIN for secure sign-in.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Passkey creation successful">
        - User successfully creates passkey and is now linked with the user account for the respective web-app.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Redirection to app dashboard">
        - User is redirected to the app dashboard.
    </Step>

</Steps>
