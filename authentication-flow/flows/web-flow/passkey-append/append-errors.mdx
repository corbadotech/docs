<Steps>
    <Step title="Passkey creation aborted during OS prompt (first attempt)">
        - User begins the passkey registration but cancels or dismisses the OS-native authentication prompt the first time.
        - The system allows the user to try the registration flow again or skip and continue with their current login method.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Passkey creation aborted during OS prompt (subsequent attempts)">
        - After one or more cancellations in the operating systemâ€™s authentication prompt (e.g., second, third, or further attempts), the user continues to see the option to retry, but may receive a supportive message encouraging completion for improved security.
        - User can always opt to skip passkey setup and proceed using traditional login credentials.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Passkey creation aborted during the append (general) screen">
        - User exits or cancels during the general initial stage of the passkey append process.
        - Since no passkey is found, user is prompted to log in using their traditional password.
    </Step>

</Steps>
