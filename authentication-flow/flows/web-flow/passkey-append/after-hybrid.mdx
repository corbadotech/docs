<Steps>
    <Step title="Login via cross device authentication">
        - User enters their identifier (email/username) on the login page in textfield.
        - System generates and displays a time-limited, unique QR code.
        - User scans the QR code using their mobile device or tablet where the passkey is stored.
        - The second device performs biometric or PIN authentication to confirm identity.
        - Authentication response is securely sent back to complete login on the desktop device.
        - User is granted access on the original device without entering a password.
        - After successful cross device authentication, user is asked to create a passkey on the current device.
        - User continues to the process and set up a passkey using fingerprint, face, or PIN for secure sign-in.
