## Sign-Up Flow

Users registering across desktop and mobile follow the same overall journey:

1. Create an account with an identifier (username + password).
2. Get prompted to create a passkey.
3. Choose to **create**, **skip**, or **abort** the process.

<Info>
    NOTE: The blue background indicates product-native steps (e.g., verification
    code). These are steps not provided by Corbado UI components but from your
    existing implementation. Passkey creation is seamlessly embedded in your
    product journey.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Registration with identifier method">
    - User enters **username & password**.
    - User creates an account by clicking **Sign up**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Auto-append immediately after registration">
    - User is prompted via auto-append to set up a passkey using fingerprint,
    face, or PIN.
    - Successfully passkey creation is completed and now the user has a passkey appended to the signed up
    account.
    - After successful passkey creation, user continues into the main product flow (verification, app dashboard).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Auto-append aborted/cancelled or skipped">
    - If the user skips, cancels, or the prompt does not show, the user continues the conventional registration. 
    - The app can later trigger the passkey append screen again for passkey creation.

    **3.a. Passkey creation via manual append**
    - User starts the append process by clicking **Continue**.
    - User successfully creates a passkey.
    - User continues into the main product flow (verification, app dashboard).

    **3.b. Passkey creation skipped**
    - User starts append but skips passkey creation.
    - User continues into the main product flow (verification, app dashboard).

  </Step>
