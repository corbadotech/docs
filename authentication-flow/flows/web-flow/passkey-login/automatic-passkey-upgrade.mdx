import { ToolingFrame } from "/snippets/authentication-flow/tooling-frame.mdx";

<Info>
    As of October 2025, this feature is only available in iOS, macOS and
    Windows. Not all password managers support it yet. Note, that it only works
    when a password is autofilled and when there is no passkey stored for the
    user yet.
