title: "Cross-Device Authentication via QR Code (Desktop)"
description: "This flow details how users sign in on a desktop device where their passkey is not available by leveraging their mobile device with stored passkeys via scanning a QR code. Passkey Intelligence automatically determines when to offer this option."

## Login via Mobile Device (Cross-Device Authentication)

This approach uses the operating system's built-in **hybrid transport** functionality (part of the CTAP 2 specification) for secure cross-device authentication.

**[Passkey Intelligence](/corbado-connect/features/passkey-intelligence)** automatically determines when to offer QR code login. It only displays the QR code option when it detects that the user has a passkey on their mobile device, ensuring a high probability of successful authentication.

<Warning>
    **Security Requirements:** Both devices must have **internet connectivity** and **Bluetooth enabled** for cross-device authentication to work. This dual-channel approach (QR code for initial pairing + Bluetooth proximity verification) is a critical phishing protection mechanism built into passkeys, ensuring the authenticating mobile device is physically near the desktop device being logged into.
</Warning>

<Steps>
    <Step title="User enters identifier">
        - User enters their identifier (email/username) on the login page in textfield.
        - System now knows which user account is attempting to log in.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Passkey Intelligence determines cross-device authentication is available">
        - The system uses [Passkey Intelligence](/corbado-connect/features/passkey-intelligence) to analyze the user's passkey availability.
        - It automatically detects that this user has a passkey stored on their mobile device.
        - Based on this intelligence, the system prepares to offer cross-device authentication via QR code.
    </Step>
    <Step title="OS displays QR code screen">
        - The operating system displays a screen preparing the user for cross-device authentication.
        - The operating system generates a QR code for secure pairing.
        - Instructions prompt the user to scan the code with their mobile device.
        - **Requirements:** Both devices must have internet and Bluetooth enabled.
    </Step>
    <Step title="User scans QR and authenticates">
        - User scans the QR code using their mobile device where the passkey is stored.
        - **Bluetooth proximity check:** The OS verifies both devices are physically close (phishing protection).
        - The mobile device performs biometric or PIN authentication.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Login completes on current device">
        - Authentication response is securely sent back via the internet connection to complete login on the desktop device.
        - User is granted access on the current device.
    </Step>
