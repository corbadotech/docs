<Note>
    In this documentation, MFA is not mandatory by default. This means
    single-factor accounts (e.g., accounts secured only with a password) are
    supported. However, MFA can be enforced if required by the application or
    compliance. When MFA is optional, the passkey append option allows users who
    initially registered without MFA to later add additional factors for
    stronger security.
