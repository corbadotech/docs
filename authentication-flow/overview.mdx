title: "Authentication Flow"
description: "This guide walks you through the authentication flow with passkeys, from first-time sign-ups to ongoing logins, fallback scenarios, and passkey management. 
The goal is to give you a clear picture of where passkey components fit into your system and how the user journey unfolds across both web applications and native apps."

## Your expected key takeaways

-   Explore the complete sign up and login experiences for your users.
-   Review all major screens, decision points, error states, and fallback cases.
-   See how passkey management integrates into both web and native app flows.
-   Understand exactly where and how authentication components fit into user journeys.

The documentation is designed to be visual and flow-oriented, so you can quickly understand the different cases and integrate them into your product with confidence.

<Note>
    In documentation, MFA is not mandatory by default. This means single-factor
    accounts (e.g., accounts secured only with a passkey or password) are
    supported. However, MFA can be enforced if required by the application or
    compliance. When MFA is optional, the passkey append option allows users who
    initially registered without MFA to later add additional factors for
    stronger security.
