## Introduction

`CorbadoAuth` serves as a comprehensive solution for user authentication, combining both account creation and login functionalities into a single, streamlined interface.

## Seamless Navigation During Authentication

The `CorbadoAuth` component employs hash-based URLs to ensure a seamless user experience during the authentication process. Here's how it benefits users:

-   **Progress Preservation:** If a user refreshes the page during sign-up, their progress is maintained. The component automatically resumes the authentication flow at the correct step.
-   **Flexible Back Navigation:** Users can easily navigate back to previous steps in the sign-up process to review or modify information without having to restart from the beginning.
-   **Direct Screen Access:** Users can directly access the sign-up or login screens using `#signup-init` (or `#register`) and `#login-init` (or `#login`) in the URL.
-   **Customization:** Developers can disable hash-based navigation if needed by setting the `handleNavigationEvents` option to false.

This navigation strategy enhances user experience by providing a seamless interaction flow and reducing the frustration typically associated with losing session data during authentication processes.

**Technical Note:** Hash-based URLs involve adding a hash symbol (#) followed by a unique identifier to the end of the website's address. This allows tracking changes within a single page without triggering a full page reload.

## API reference

| Name                   | Type              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| onLoggedIn             | callback function | This callback function is called whenever a user has been authenticated (i.e., after every login, but also after a sign-up). You can use it to navigate the user to a specific page inside your application (e.g., /home). |
| handleNavigationEvents | boolean           | If enabled, the user can navigate between screens during the authentication process. When disabled, the user will leave the authentication process immediately when he navigates back or refresh page.                    |

<Note>
    This component requires the `CorbadoProvider` component. Most configuration settings
    will be applied there so make sure to check out the available settings of the
    `Corbado Provider` (see your framework's integration guide for more info).
