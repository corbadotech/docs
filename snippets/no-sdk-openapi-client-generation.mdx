To simplify the integration of Corbado into your {language} application you can autogenerate a client/SDK. Since the Corbado Backend API follows the API standard OpenAPI (version 3.0.3) this is quite easy:

1) Download the official [OpenAPI specification](https://api.corbado.com/docs/api/openapi/backend_api_public.yml)
2) Take an OpenAPI generator, for example [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/)
3) Generate the client/SDK for {language} and start using it in your application
