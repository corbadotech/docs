First, you need to [set up a Corbado project](/overview/getting-started).

To get started with the integration, install the Corbado React package.

```bash
npm install @corbado/react
```

If your project uses TypeScript, you should also install the types for the package.

```bash
npm install -D @corbado/types
```
