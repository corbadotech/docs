## Token Validation

The **session-token** is a JWT that requires validation. The `validateToken()` (or similar) function performs the following tasks:

- Verifies the JWT signature using Corbado's public keys (JWKS).
- Checks the token's expiration, validity, and other claims.
- Returns the decoded claims if the token is valid, or throws an error if it is not.
