<Note>To fully understand the following section make yourself familiar with the [Corbado session management](/sessions/overview)!</Note>

To verify if a user is logged in your {language} application needs to verify the short-term session (represented as JWT). Corbado utilizes the **RS256** algorithm (see [JWT security](/sessions/security/jwt-security) for more details) for its JWTs.

To obtain the public keys required for verifying the JWT signature, you need to retrieve the **JWKS** (JSON Web Key Set). The JWKS is located at the Frontend API URL, for example:

https://pro-771306541694234650.frontendapi.corbado.io/.well-known/jwks

Besides verifying the signature you need to check the following JWT claims:

| Claim     | Description      | Check                                     |
| --------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **exp**   | Expiration Time | Must be in future                          |
| **nbf**   | Not Before      | Must be in past                            |
| **iss**   | Issuer          | Must be Frontend API URL (or CNAME if set) |

<Warning>Make sure your JWT library supports JWKS caching, otherwise each JWT verification will result in an HTTP request to fetch the JWKS!</Warning>
