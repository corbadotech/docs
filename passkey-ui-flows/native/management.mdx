## Create, Manage or Delete Passkeys via Passkey List Component

Passkey management lets users view, update, and remove the passkeys saved on their devices. It ensures users stay in control of which accounts are linked to which devices, and gives them the option to revoke access if a device is lost or no longer in use.

    <Step title="When No Passkey is Created for the User Account">
        - When the user has no passkey linked, the passkey list is shown empty.

    <Step title="Passkey Delete Modal">
        - User can simply delete existing passkeys from the list shown by
        clicking on the "X" icon on the top right corner of any passkey listed.
        - This action is not reversible, so the user is again asked for
        confirmation on deletion of passkey. This leads to permanent passkey
        deletion. - User has the ability to create a new one.

### WebAuthn Signal API for Client-Side Synchronization

<Info>
    **Advanced Feature:** The [WebAuthn Signal API](https://www.corbado.com/blog/webauthn-signal-api) enables seamless synchronization between your server and the user's device. When a user deletes a passkey from your account settings or updates their user information (like email or display name), this API automatically removes or updates the corresponding passkey on the client-side authenticator (password manager or OS).
</Info>

**Platform Support:**
- ✅ **iOS and macOS:** Supported on newer versions
- ✅ **Windows:** Chrome with Google Password Manager
- ✅ **Android:** Native support and Chrome support following

**What the Signal API Does:**

1. **Automatic Deletion on Client:** When users delete a passkey from your passkey list, the [WebAuthn Signal API](https://www.corbado.com/blog/webauthn-signal-api) signals the client-side authenticator to remove it. This prevents deleted passkeys from appearing in future login prompts (Conditional UI), improving user experience.

2. **Metadata Updates:** If user information changes (e.g., email address update), the Signal API updates the passkey's metadata (`user.name`, `user.displayName`) on the client-side. This ensures users see current information when selecting passkeys during login.

<Tip>
    The Signal API operates silently and privacy-preserving - it doesn't provide feedback about whether the update succeeded, maintaining user privacy while keeping credentials synchronized.
