    **Product-Native Steps:** The blue background indicates optional product-native steps (e.g., verification code, setup PIN, enabling biometrics). **PIN and local biometrics are optional features** for protecting app access within sessions after passkey authentication completes. Learn more about [how passkeys and local biometrics work together](https://www.corbado.com/blog/passkeys-local-biometrics) to provide both secure remote authentication (passkeys) and convenient app protection (local biometrics).
