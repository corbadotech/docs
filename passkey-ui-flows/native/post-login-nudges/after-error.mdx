## Passkey Creation after Login Error (Autohealing)

When users experience errors during passkey login, the system intelligently falls back to traditional authentication and then offers to create a new passkey to replace the broken one. This **autohealing** mechanism ensures users can quickly recover access.

### Common Scenarios Leading to Passkey Login Errors

Passkey login errors can occur in several situations:

- **Locally deleted passkeys**: The user has deleted their passkey from their device or password manager
- **Different cloud account**: The user is logged into a similar device they've used before, but it's now connected to a different iCloud account (or different Google account on Android)
- **Logged-out password manager**: The user has signed out of their password manager that stored the passkey

### How Passkey Intelligence Enables Auto-Healing

**[Passkey Intelligence](/corbado-connect/features/passkey-intelligence)** monitors the authentication flow and detects when passkey login fails repeatedly. After the user successfully authenticates via traditional methods, it automatically suggests creating a new passkey to heal the broken authentication state. This smart system helps identify underlying account or device synchronization issues while ensuring users can quickly recover access.

<Tip>
    This autohealing mechanism is part of a broader [passkey fallback and recovery strategy](https://www.corbado.com/blog/passkey-fallback-recovery). Learn more about designing resilient authentication systems that handle passkey errors gracefully while maintaining security.

<Steps>
    <Step title="User enters identifier">
        - User enters their identifier (email/username) on the login page.
        - System now knows which user account is attempting to log in.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Passkey Intelligence detects existing passkey">
        - [Passkey Intelligence](/corbado-connect/features/passkey-intelligence) analyzes the user's passkey availability.
        - It detects the user has a passkey registered and automatically initiates passkey login.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Passkey login errors occur">
        - User encounters one or more passkey login errors (e.g., first error, second error).
        - Common causes: deleted passkey, different cloud account, logged-out password manager.
        - System recognizes repeated login failures.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Fallback to traditional login method">
        - After multiple failed passkey login attempts, system falls back to traditional login method (username + password).
        - User successfully logs in using their password.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Autohealing: Passkey append initiates">
        - [Passkey Intelligence](/corbado-connect/features/passkey-intelligence) detects the broken passkey situation and triggers autohealing.
        - User is offered an option to create a new passkey to replace the broken one.
    </Step>
    <Step title="OS-native biometric modal appears">
        - User continues to set up a new passkey using fingerprint, face, or PIN for secure sign-in.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Passkey creation successful (healing complete)">
        - User successfully creates a new passkey, replacing the broken one.
        - The account is now healed with a working passkey.
    </Step>
     <Step title="App PIN setup">
        - After successful passkey creation, the user is signed in and is asked
        to set up PIN.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Enable local biometric for app login">
        - User is allowed to enable/disable local biometric app login (provided
        as product feature).
    </Step>
