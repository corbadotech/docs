## Identifier-First Login

This is an **identifier-first flow** where users enter their identifier (email, phone, or username) into the login textfield first. The system then uses **[Passkey Intelligence](/corbado-connect/features/passkey-intelligence)** to automatically determine if passkey login should be triggered on the current device or via cross-device authentication.

**Critical for Login Success:** Passkey Intelligence only triggers platform or cross-device login when there's a high probability of success. This smart decision-making significantly increases overall login completion rates by avoiding failed authentication attempts.

<Info>
    **How Passkey Intelligence Works:** After the user enters their identifier, the system uses [Passkey Intelligence](/corbado-connect/features/passkey-intelligence) to make smart decisions about authentication. It only triggers platform authentication or cross-device login when there's a high likelihood of success. This prevents users from encountering failed authentication attempts, which significantly improves overall login completion rates.

    **Configuration Options:** This flow can be configured in different ways based on your requirements:
    
    - **Option 1: `preferImmediatelyAvailableCredentials`** - Restricts to immediately available passkeys on this device. When the user enters their identifier, this configuration filters the displayed passkeys to only show those matching the entered identifier, providing a streamlined experience.
    
    - **Option 2: Full support** - Allows security keys and cross-device authentication (CDA). Security key support may be desired for certain use cases, while CDA is less commonly used on native apps.
    
    [Passkey Intelligence](/corbado-connect/features/passkey-intelligence) helps determine which configuration is optimal for your use case. Contact us for implementation guidance on advanced configurations.

<Steps>
    <Step title="User enters identifier">
        - User types their identifier (email, phone, or username) into the login textfield in the native app.
        - System now knows which user account is attempting to log in.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Passkey Intelligence determines authentication method">
        - The system uses [Passkey Intelligence](/corbado-connect/features/passkey-intelligence) to analyze if this user has a passkey available.
        - It intelligently determines the best authentication approach:
          - **Platform authentication:** If a passkey is stored on the current device
          - **Cross-device authentication:** If a passkey exists on a mobile device
          - **Fallback to traditional login:** If no viable passkey route is detected
        - **Key advantage:** Only triggers passkey login if there's a high probability of success, preventing user frustration from failed attempts.
    </Step>
    <Step title="OS-native passkey prompt appears">
        - If Passkey Intelligence determines a passkey is available, the system automatically triggers the authentication prompt.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Biometric authentication prompt appears">
        - User verifies their identity using the device's screen lock (fingerprint, PIN, or face recognition).  
        - Upon successful verification, the user is seamlessly logged in.
    </Step>
