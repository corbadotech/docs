## In-App Nudge: After Unlock (Post-Authentication)

This In-App Nudge appears immediately after users unlock the app with [local biometrics](https://www.corbado.com/blog/passkeys-local-biometrics), offering them the opportunity to create a passkey for enhanced future authentication. This approach maximizes visibility but triggers two consecutive biometric prompts.

<Info>
    **Local Biometrics vs. Passkeys:** [Local biometrics](https://www.corbado.com/blog/passkeys-local-biometrics) (Touch ID, Face ID, fingerprint) re-verify your identity WITHIN an already authenticated session to protect app access. **Passkeys**, on the other hand, perform INITIAL remote authentication to establish your identity with the backend server. They serve complementary purposes: local biometrics protect the app session, while passkeys enable secure, phishing-resistant login. By creating a passkey after local biometric login, users gain a superior authentication method for future logins while still benefiting from local biometric protection for app access.

<Steps>
     <Step title="App unlock using local biometric">
        - User unlocks the app using local biometrics (e.g., Touch ID, Face ID or PIN).
        - User is now authenticated within the app session.
    </Step>
    <Step title="In-App Nudge appears immediately after unlock">
        - **Smart display logic:** [Passkey Intelligence](/corbado-connect/features/passkey-intelligence) first determines if the nudge should appear by checking:
          - User doesn't already have a passkey on this ecosystem/OS
          - Device is passkey-ready (has screen lock/PIN configured)
          - Context is appropriate
        - If conditions are met, the In-App Nudge appears immediately offering passkey creation.
        - This approach maximizes visibility but results in two consecutive biometric prompts (unlock + passkey creation). Some developers prefer the [After CTA](/passkey-ui-flows/native/passkey-creation/in-app-after-cta) approach to avoid this, though immediate triggering ensures higher exposure.
    </Step>
    <Step title="User chooses to create passkey">
        - If user accepts, OS-native biometric modal appears for passkey creation.
        - User authenticates via biometrics (this is the second biometric prompt in sequence).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Passkey creation successful">
        - User successfully creates passkey and is now linked with the user account for the respective native app.
        - Future logins will use the passkey for superior security.
    </Step>
