## Overview

These visual UI flow diagrams showcase **best-practice passkey authentication** as implemented in [Corbado Connect](/corbado-connect/overview/welcome), our enterprise-grade passkey solution. While these flows are production-tested patterns from our platform, they serve as **universal best practices** that any team can use to implement passkey authentication optimally.

<Info>
    **Powered by Corbado Connect:** These flows represent the reference implementation from [Corbado Connect](/corbado-connect/overview/welcome), featuring [Passkey Intelligence](/corbado-connect/features/passkey-intelligence), smart fallback strategies, and platform-optimized UX patterns. You can implement these exact patterns in your own solution or use Corbado Connect to get them out-of-the-box.

## What You'll Learn

-   **Complete user journeys:** Explore the full sign-up and login experiences across all platforms
-   **Every decision point:** Review all major screens, error states, and fallback scenarios  
-   **Platform-specific patterns:** See how passkeys work on iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows
-   **Real-world edge cases:** Understand error handling, cross-device scenarios, and recovery flows
-   **Production-ready UX:** Learn from enterprise-tested patterns that maximize passkey adoption

The documentation is designed to be visual and flow-oriented, showing actual UI screens and user decision trees so you can quickly understand each scenario and integrate it into your product with confidence.

## UI Flow Categories

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Web UI Flows" icon="globe" href="/passkey-ui-flows/web/sign-up">
    Complete web authentication patterns including sign-up, login methods (One-Tap, Conditional UI, Identifier-First, Cross-Device QR), post-login nudges, and passkey management.
</Card>

<Card title="Native App UI Flows" icon="mobile" href="/passkey-ui-flows/native/sign-up">
    Mobile app authentication patterns with platform-specific implementations, local biometrics integration, and In-App Nudge strategies.

<Note>
    In this documentation, MFA is not mandatory by default. This means
    single-factor accounts (e.g., accounts secured only with a password) are
    supported. However, MFA can be enforced if required by the application or
    compliance. When MFA is optional, the passkey append option allows users who
    initially registered without MFA to later add additional factors for
    stronger security.
</Note>

## Using These Flows

**For Corbado Connect Users:** These flows are what you get out-of-the-box with [Corbado Connect](/corbado-connect/overview/welcome). Our UI components and [Passkey Intelligence](/corbado-connect/features/passkey-intelligence) automatically handle all these scenarios for you.

**For Custom Implementations:** Use these flows as your reference implementation to build passkey authentication that follows industry best practices and maximizes user adoption.
