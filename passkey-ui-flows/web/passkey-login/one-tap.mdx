## One-Tap Login Flow

Users logging in via desktop and mobile browsers follow a standard login flow enriched by the One-Tap passkey experience, leading to higher login rates on trusted devices.

### Platform-Specific Implementations

The One-Tap Login experience adapts seamlessly to each platform's native authentication UI, ensuring users receive a familiar and trusted interface:

    />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Steps>
    <Step title="Users log in via One-Tap">
        - Corbado detects the user has a passkey linked to the platform. User taps "Login with Passkey" button on the login screen to start authentication.
        - The button displays personalized information (e.g., "Login as alice@example.com") for improved user recognition.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Automatic OS-native biometric modal appears">
        - The system prompts for available saved passkey using the browser's or OS-native modal (for example, Touch ID).
        - User verifies their identity using their screen lock (e.g., fingerprint, PIN, or face recognition).
        - The authentication happens locally on the device - no passwords are transmitted over the network.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Access granted">
        - User is seamlessly logged in and redirected to the dashboard.
        - The entire process typically completes in under 2 seconds.
    </Step>

</Steps>

## Technical Considerations

### Device Recognition
The One-Tap Login button appears intelligently based on:
- **Passkey availability**: Whether the user has previously created a passkey on this device
- **Browser support**: Automatic detection of WebAuthn compatibility
- **Session history**: Recognition of the last used account on the device

### Edge Cases and Fallbacks

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Multiple accounts on the same device">
When multiple accounts exist on a device, the One-Tap button defaults to the most recently used account. Users can easily switch accounts through a dropdown or "Use another account" option.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="First-time device access">
On a new device, users complete the standard authentication flow once. After successful passkey creation or migration, One-Tap Login becomes available for all subsequent visits.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Passkey unavailable scenarios">
If a passkey becomes unavailable (e.g., deleted by user, browser issues), the system gracefully falls back to alternative authentication methods without user confusion.
