## Conditional UI Flow (Usernameless Login)

The Conditional UI flow is automatically triggered by the browser/OS when passkeys are available. This is a **usernameless login flow** - users don't enter their username first. Instead, they select from available passkeys, and the system determines the user's identity after successful authentication.

Passkeys appear in different ways depending on the platform: on the keyboard's suggestion bar (iOS), as an overlay (iOS/Android), or as a selection dropdown (Desktop). This allows users to select and log in quickly without opening an extra prompt.

<Info>
    **Key Technical Detail:** Unlike traditional login where users enter their username first, Conditional UI is a usernameless flow. The system displays ALL available passkeys for the domain/app, and only learns the user's identity AFTER they select and authenticate with their specific passkey. This enables a seamless experience.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Conditional UI automatically triggered">
        - When the user taps on the email field, the browser/OS automatically triggers Conditional UI, displaying ALL available passkeys for that domain (usernameless approach).
        - The presentation varies by platform: keyboard suggestion bar (iOS mobile), overlay modal (iOS/Android mobile), or dropdown selection (Desktop).
        - Note: At this point, the system doesn't know which user is trying to log in.
    </Step>
     <Step title="Authenticate using the selected passkey">
        - The user selects their passkey from the available options, which identifies them to the system.
        - User verifies their identity using their screen lock (e.g., fingerprint, PIN, or face recognition).
        - Upon successful verification, the system receives the user's identity information from the passkey credential.
    </Step>
     <Step title="Access granted">
        - The system now knows which user has authenticated based on the passkey credential response.
        - User is seamlessly logged in and redirected to the dashboard.
    </Step>
