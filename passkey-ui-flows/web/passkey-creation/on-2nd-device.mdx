## Passkey Creation on Device Without Access to Existing Passkeys

Users logging into a device where their existing passkeys are not accessible (e.g., logging into a mobile phone but only having a Windows Hello passkey which is device-bound and cannot be used on mobile phones or different Windows computers) follow this flow. **[Passkey Intelligence](/corbado-connect/features/passkey-intelligence)** recognizes the user has passkeys but they can't be accessed on this device, so it declines passkey login and allows the user to append a new passkey on the current device.

<Steps>
    <Step title="User enters identifier">
        - User enters their identifier (email/username) on the login page.
        - System now knows which user account is attempting to log in.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Passkey Intelligence analyzes and declines passkey login">
        - [Passkey Intelligence](/corbado-connect/features/passkey-intelligence) analyzes the user's passkey availability.
        - It detects the user has at least one passkey registered on their account.
        - However, those existing passkeys are NOT accessible on this device (e.g., user has a Windows Hello passkey which is device-bound and cannot be used on this mobile phone).
        - Passkey Intelligence declines to initiate passkey login because it would fail.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Fallback to traditional login method">
        - System falls back to traditional login method (username + password).
        - User successfully logs in using their password.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Passkey append initiates on current device">
        - After successful login, the system offers to create a passkey on this device.
        - This allows the user to have a passkey accessible on this device for future logins.
    </Step>
    <Step title="OS-native biometric modal appears">
        - The user chooses a biometric method or PIN to set up the passkey.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Passkey creation successful">
        - User successfully creates a new passkey on the current device.
        - The user now has passkeys on multiple devices.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Redirection to app dashboard">
        - User is redirected to the app dashboard.
    </Step>
