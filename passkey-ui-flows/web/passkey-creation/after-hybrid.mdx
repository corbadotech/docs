## Passkey Creation after Hybrid Login

This approach uses the operating system's built-in **hybrid transport** functionality (part of the CTAP 2 specification) for secure cross-device authentication.

**[Passkey Intelligence](/corbado-connect/features/passkey-intelligence)** automatically determines when to offer QR code login based on detecting that the user has a passkey on their mobile device.

<Warning>
    **Security Requirements:** Both devices must have **internet connectivity** and **Bluetooth enabled** for cross-device authentication to work. This dual-channel approach (QR code for initial pairing + Bluetooth proximity verification) is a critical phishing protection mechanism built into passkeys.
</Warning>

<Steps>
    <Step title="User enters identifier">
        - User enters their identifier (email/username) on the login page in text field.
        - System now knows which user account is attempting to log in.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Passkey Intelligence determines cross-device authentication is available">
        - The system uses [Passkey Intelligence](/corbado-connect/features/passkey-intelligence) to analyze the user's passkey availability.
        - It automatically detects that this user has a passkey stored on their mobile device.
        - Based on this intelligence, the system prepares to offer cross-device authentication via QR code.
    </Step>
    <Step title="OS displays QR code screen">
        - The operating system displays a screen preparing the user for cross-device authentication.
        - The operating system generates a QR code for secure pairing.
        - **Requirements:** Both devices must have internet and Bluetooth enabled.
    </Step>
    <Step title="User scans QR and authenticates">
        - User scans the QR code using their mobile device where the passkey is stored.
        - **Bluetooth proximity check:** The OS verifies both devices are physically close (phishing protection).
        - The mobile device performs biometric or PIN authentication.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Login completes on current device & passkey append initiates">
        - Authentication response is securely sent back via the internet connection to complete login on the current device.
        - User is granted access on the current device.
        - After successful cross device authentication, user is asked to create a passkey on the current device.
    </Step>
    <Step title="OS-native biometric modal appears">
        - User chooses and continues to set up a passkey using fingerprint, face, or PIN for secure sign-in.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Passkey creation successful">
        - User successfully creates a passkey and it is now linked with the user account for the respective web-app.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Redirection to app dashboard">
        - User is redirected to the app dashboard.
    </Step>
