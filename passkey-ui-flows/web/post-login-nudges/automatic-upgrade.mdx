import { ToolingFrame } from "/snippets/authentication-flow/tooling-frame.mdx";

<Info>
    As of October 2025, this feature is only available in iOS, macOS and
    Windows (Chrome+GPM). Not all password managers support it yet. Note, that it only works
    when a password is autofilled and when there is no passkey stored for the
    user yet.
</Info>

## Automatic Passkey Creation after Login

Users logging in via a browser follow a standard login flow enriched by the automatic passkey upgrade after the successful login used a password manager to autofill a password.

**[Passkey Intelligence](/corbado-connect/features/passkey-intelligence)** works in the background to enable this feature, ensuring automatic passkey creation only happens when conditions are optimal for success.
