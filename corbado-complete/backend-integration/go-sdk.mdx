description: "Use the official Corbado Go SDK to simplify integrating passkey authentication and session management into your Go applications."
---

Once Corbado is integrated into your frontend, users can log in using passkeys. Upon successful login, they will receive a **session-token**. By default, this **session-token** is stored in a cookie and sent to your backend with every request (if same-origin; refer to [session-token handling](/corbado-complete/sessions/session-token-handling) for more details).

To verify if a user is authenticated and to retrieve user data, you must validate the **session-token** in your backend. The official [Corbado Go SDK](https://github.com/corbado/corbado-go) facilitates this process with its `ValidateToken()` function.

## Token Validation

The **session-token** is a JWT that requires validation. The `ValidateToken()` function performs the following tasks:

- It verifies the JWT signature using Corbado's public keys (JWKS).
- It checks the token's expiration, validity, and other claims.
- It returns the decoded claims if the token is valid, or an error if it is not.

## Implementation

Below is an example of how to use the `ValidateToken()` function. As previously mentioned, by default, the **session-token** is stored in a cookie and sent to your backend. You will need to retrieve this cookie based on the HTTP framework you are using.

<Info>
  You can find instructions for installing and initializing the Corbado Go SDK in the official [README](https://github.com/corbado/corbado-go).
</Info>

```go
// Initialize SDK with your project ID, API secret, frontend API URL, and backend API URL
config, err := corbado.NewConfig("<Your Project ID>", "<Your API secret>", "<Your Frontend API URL>", "<Your Backend API URL>")
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

sdk, err := corbado.NewSDK(config)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

// Retrieve session-token (e.g., from a cookie)
sessionToken := "..."

// Validate session-token
user, err := sdk.Sessions().ValidateToken(sessionToken)
if err != nil {
    // session-token is invalid
    panic(err)
}

// session-token is valid
fmt.Println(user.UserID)
```

## Why is this important?

- Ensures only valid, untampered tokens are accepted.
- Protects your backend endpoints from unauthorized access.
- Handles key rotation and validation logic for you.
