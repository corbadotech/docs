After integrating Corbado in your frontend, your users authenticate and receive a session token. Pass this token (from a cookie or header) to your backend and validate it as described below. [Learn more about session token handling.](/corbado-complete/sessions/session-token-handling)

## Token validation (JWT)

To validate a Corbado session token (JWT) in C++, use a JWT library such as [jwt-cpp](https://github.com/Thalhammer/jwt-cpp). You need to fetch the JWKS (public keys) from Corbado and verify the token's signature and claims.

```cpp
#include <jwt-cpp/jwt.h>
#include <string>

// Fetch the session token from a cookie or Authorization header.
// See session token handling for details: https://docs.corbado.com/corbado-complete/sessions/session-token-handling
std::string token = /* the JWT from the client */;
std::string jwks_json = /* fetch and cache JWKS from Corbado */;

// Parse JWKS and get the public key (see jwt-cpp docs for details)
// ...

try {
    auto decoded = jwt::decode(token);
    // Use the public key from JWKS to verify
    auto verifier = jwt::verify()
        .allow_algorithm(jwt::algorithm::rs256(public_key_from_jwks, "", ""))
        .with_issuer("https://<your-project-id>.frontendapi.corbado.io");
    verifier.verify(decoded);
    // Token is valid
} catch (const std::exception& e) {
    // Token is invalid
}
```

## JWT libraries

There are multiple JWT libraries available for C++. Here is one of them:
