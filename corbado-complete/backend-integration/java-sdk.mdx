description: "Use the official Corbado Java SDK to simplify the passkey and session management integration in your Java applications."

Once Corbado is integrated into your frontend, users can log in using passkeys. Upon successful login, they will receive a **session-token**.

By default, this **session-token** is stored in a cookie and sent to your backend with every request (if same-origin; refer to [session-token handling](/corbado-complete/sessions/session-token-handling) for more details).

To verify if a user is authenticated and to retrieve user data, you must validate the **session-token** in your backend. The official [Corbado Java SDK](https://github.com/corbado/corbado-java) facilitates this process with its `validateToken()` function.

## Token Validation

The **session-token** is a JWT that requires validation. The `validateToken()` function performs the following tasks:

- Verifies the JWT signature using Corbado's public keys (JWKS).
- Checks the token's expiration, validity, and other claims.
- Returns the decoded claims if the token is valid, or throws an error if it is not.

## Implementation

<Info>
  You can find instructions for installing and initializing the Corbado Java SDK in the official [README](https://github.com/corbado/corbado-java).
</Info>

Below is an example of how to use the `validateToken()` function. You will need to retrieve the session-token from a cookie or header, depending on your HTTP framework.

```java
import com.corbado.Corbado;
import com.corbado.CorbadoConfig;

// Initialize SDK with your project ID, API secret, and optionally backend API URL
Config config = Config.builder().apiSecret(apiSecret).projectId(projectId).build();
CorbadoSDK sdk = new CorbadoSDK(config);

// Retrieve session-token (e.g., from a cookie or header)
String sessionToken = "...";

// Validate session-token
User user = sdk.sessions().validateToken(sessionToken);
// user.getUserId() etc. are now available
```
## Why is this important?

- Ensures only valid, untampered tokens are accepted.
- Protects your backend endpoints from unauthorized access.
- Handles key rotation and validation logic for you.
