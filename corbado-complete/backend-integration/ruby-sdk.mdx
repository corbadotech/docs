After integrating Corbado in your frontend, your users authenticate and receive a session token. Pass this token (from a cookie or header) to your backend and validate it as described below. [Learn more about session token handling.](/corbado-complete/sessions/session-token-handling)

## Token validation (JWT)

Since there is no official Corbado Ruby SDK, you need to validate session tokens (JWTs) manually in your backend. This ensures that only valid, untampered tokens are accepted for authentication.

To validate a Corbado session token (JWT) in Ruby, use a JWT library such as [ruby-jwt](https://github.com/jwt/ruby-jwt). You need to fetch the JWKS (public keys) from Corbado and verify the token's signature and claims.

- Verifies the JWT signature using Corbado's public keys (JWKS).
- Checks the token's expiration and validity.
- Returns the decoded claims if the token is valid, or throws an error otherwise.

### How to use

```ruby
require 'jwt'
require 'net/http'
require 'json'

# Fetch the session token from a cookie or Authorization header.
# See session token handling for details: https://docs.corbado.com/corbado-complete/sessions/session-token-handling
session_token = '...'

# Fetch JWKS from Corbado and cache it
jwks_uri = URI('https://<your-project-id>.frontendapi.corbado.io/.well-known/jwks.json')
jwks_raw = Net::HTTP.get(jwks_uri)
jwks_keys = JSON.parse(jwks_raw)['keys']

# Extract the public key (see ruby-jwt docs for details)
# ...

begin
  decoded_token = JWT.decode(
    session_token,
    public_key_from_jwks, # Replace with actual key extraction
    true,
    {
      algorithm: 'RS256',
      iss: 'https://<your-project-id>.frontendapi.corbado.io',
      verify_iss: true,
      # ... other claim checks ...
    }
  )
  # Token is valid, decoded_token contains the payload
rescue JWT::DecodeError => e
  # Token is invalid
end
```

### Why is this important?
- Ensures only valid, untampered tokens are accepted.
- Protects your backend endpoints from unauthorized access.
- Handles key rotation and validation logic for you.

## JWT libraries

There are multiple JWT libraries available for Ruby. Here is one of them:
