After integrating Corbado in your frontend, your users authenticate and receive a session token. Pass this token (from a cookie or header) to your backend and validate it as described below. [Learn more about session token handling.](/corbado-complete/sessions/session-token-handling)

## Token validation (JWT)

Since there is no official Corbado Perl SDK, you need to validate session tokens (JWTs) manually in your backend. This ensures that only valid, untampered tokens are accepted for authentication.

To validate a Corbado session token (JWT) in Perl, use a JWT library such as [Crypt::JWT](https://metacpan.org/pod/Crypt::JWT). You need to fetch the JWKS (public keys) from Corbado and verify the token's signature and claims.

- Verifies the JWT signature using Corbado's public keys (JWKS).
- Checks the token's expiration and validity.
- Returns the decoded claims if the token is valid, or throws an error otherwise.

### How to use

```perl
use Crypt::JWT qw(decode_jwt);
use LWP::Simple;
use JSON;

# Fetch the session token from a cookie or Authorization header.
# See session token handling for details: https://docs.corbado.com/corbado-complete/sessions/session-token-handling
my $sessionToken = '...';

# Fetch JWKS from Corbado and cache it
my $jwks_url = 'https://<your-project-id>.frontendapi.corbado.io/.well-known/jwks.json';
my $jwks_json = get($jwks_url);
my $jwks = decode_json($jwks_json);

# Extract the public key (see Crypt::JWT docs for details)
# ...

# Verify the token
my $claims;
eval {
    $claims = decode_jwt(
        token => $sessionToken,
        key => $public_key_from_jwks,
        accepted_alg => 'RS256',
        verify_exp => 1,
        verify_aud => 1,
        # ... other claim checks ...
    );
};
if ($@) {
    # Token is invalid
} else {
    # Token is valid, $claims contains the payload
}
```

### Why is this important?
- Ensures only valid, untampered tokens are accepted.
- Protects your backend endpoints from unauthorized access.
- Handles key rotation and validation logic for you.

## JWT libraries

There are multiple JWT libraries available for Perl. Here is one of them:
