After integrating Corbado in your frontend, your users authenticate and receive a session token. Pass this token (from a cookie or header) to your backend and validate it as described below. [Learn more about session token handling.](/corbado-complete/sessions/session-token-handling)

Since there is no official Corbado Rust SDK, you need to validate session tokens (JWTs) manually in your backend. This ensures that only valid, untampered tokens are accepted for authentication. We recommend using a JWT library such as [jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/Keats/jsonwebtoken).

The following sections show how to perform this validation and explain what each step does.

<Note>
You will also need to take care of the following steps:
- [OpenAPI client generation](#openapi-client-generation)
- [Session handling](#session-handling)

## How to manually validate a Corbado session token (JWT) in Rust

```rust
use jsonwebtoken::{decode, DecodingKey, Validation, Algorithm};
use reqwest;
use serde_json::Value;

// Fetch the session token from a cookie or Authorization header.
// See session token handling for details: https://docs.corbado.com/corbado-complete/sessions/session-token-handling
let session_token = "...";

// Fetch JWKS from Corbado and cache it
let jwks_url = "https://<your-project-id>.frontendapi.corbado.io/.well-known/jwks.json";
let jwks_json = reqwest::blocking::get(jwks_url)?.text()?;
let jwks: Value = serde_json::from_str(&jwks_json)?;

// Extract the public key (see jsonwebtoken docs for details)
// ...

let mut validation = Validation::new(Algorithm::RS256);
validation.set_issuer(&["https://<your-project-id>.frontendapi.corbado.io"]);

let token_data = decode::<Claims>(
    &session_token,
    &DecodingKey::from_rsa_pem(public_key_from_jwks)?,
    &validation,
)?;
// Token is valid, token_data.claims contains the payload
// Handle errors as needed
```
### What does this validation do?
- Verifies the JWT signature using Corbado's public keys (JWKS).
- Checks the token's expiration and validity.
- Returns the decoded claims if the token is valid, or throws an error otherwise.

### Why is this important?
- Ensures only valid, untampered tokens are accepted.
- Protects your backend endpoints from unauthorized access.
- Handles key rotation and validation logic for you.

## JWT libraries

There are multiple JWT libraries available for Rust. Here is one of them:
