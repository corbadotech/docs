Once Corbado is integrated into your frontend, users can log in using passkeys. Upon successful login, they will receive a **session-token**.

By default, this **session-token** is stored in a cookie and sent to your backend with every request (if same-origin; refer to [session-token handling](/corbado-complete/sessions/session-token-handling) for more details).

To verify if a user is authenticated and to retrieve user data, you must validate the **session-token** in your backend. The official [Corbado Node.js SDK](https://github.com/corbado/corbado-nodejs) facilitates this process with its `validateToken()` function.

## Token Validation

The **session-token** is a JWT that requires validation. The `validateToken()` function performs the following tasks:

- Verifies the JWT signature using Corbado's public keys (JWKS).
- Checks the token's expiration, validity, and other claims.
- Returns the decoded claims if the token is valid, or throws an error if it is not.

## Implementation

<Info>
  You can find instructions for installing and initializing the Corbado Node.js SDK in the official [README](https://github.com/corbado/corbado-nodejs).
</Info>

Below is an example of how to use the `validateToken()` function. You will need to retrieve the session-token from a cookie or header, depending on your HTTP framework.

```js
import { SDK, Config } from '@corbado/node-sdk';

const projectID = process.env.CORBADO_PROJECT_ID;
const apiSecret = process.env.CORBADO_API_SECRET;
const frontendAPI = process.env.CORBADO_FRONTEND_API;
const backendAPI = process.env.CORBADO_BACKEND_API;

const config = new Config(projectID, apiSecret, frontendAPI, backendAPI);
const sdk = new SDK(config);

// Retrieve session-token (e.g., from a cookie or header)
const sessionToken = '...';

// Validate session-token
const user = await sdk.sessions().validateToken(sessionToken);
// user.userId etc. are now available
```
## Why is this important?

- Ensures only valid, untampered tokens are accepted.
- Protects your backend endpoints from unauthorized access.
- Handles key rotation and validation logic for you.
