After integrating Corbado in your frontend, your users authenticate and receive a session token. Pass this token (from a cookie or header) to your backend and validate it as shown below. [Learn more about session token handling.](/corbado-complete/sessions/session-token-handling)

The Corbado Python SDK can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/corbado/corbado-python). The [README](https://github.com/corbado/corbado-python) there contains detailed information on how to install and use the Corbado Python SDK.

To help you securely validate session tokens in your Python backend, the following sections explain how the `validate_token()` function works and how to use it in practice.

## Token Validation with `ValidateToken()`

The Corbado Go SDK provides a `ValidateToken()` function to help you securely validate session tokens (JWTs) issued by Corbado. This is essential for verifying the authenticity and integrity of user sessions in your backend.

### What does `ValidateToken()` do?
- Verifies the JWT signature using Corbado's public keys (JWKS).
- Checks the token's expiration and validity.
- Returns the decoded claims if the token is valid, or an error otherwise.

### How to use

```python
from corbado import Config, CorbadoSDK

config = Config(project_id="<project_id>", api_secret="<api_secret>")
sdk = CorbadoSDK(config=config)

# Get sessionToken from cookie or Authorization header
# See session token handling for details: https://docs.corbado.com/corbado-complete/sessions/session-token-handling
session_token = '...'
user = sdk.sessions().validate_token(session_token)
# user.user_id etc. are now available
```

### Why is this important?
- Ensures only valid, untampered tokens are accepted.
- Protects your backend endpoints from unauthorized access.
- Handles key rotation and validation logic for you.
