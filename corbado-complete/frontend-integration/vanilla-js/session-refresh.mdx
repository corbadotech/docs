[Corbado Session Management](/corbado-complete/sessions/overview) includes an optional session refresh mechanism.

No additional implementation is needed for your JavaScript application, as this is already managed by `Corbado.load()` which you need to include on each page (see [Setup](/corbado-complete/frontend-integration/vanilla-js)).

<Note>
  You can safely call `Corbado.load()` multiple times on the same page; it manages repeated calls internally.
