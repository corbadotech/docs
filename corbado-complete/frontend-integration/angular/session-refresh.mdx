[Corbado Session Management](/corbado-complete/sessions/overview) includes an optional session refresh mechanism.

No additional implementation is needed for your Angular application, as this is already managed by `Corbado.load()` in `ngOnInit` (see [Setup](/corbado-complete/frontend-integration/angular)).
