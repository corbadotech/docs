## 1. Install dependencies

When cloning the example, all dependencies are already set up, and you just need to run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

If you start from scratch you need to install the `corbado_auth` Package:

```bash
flutter pub add corbado_auth
```

## 2. Initialize Corbado

First, we need to set up the Corbado provider. The provider setup should be placed in a dedicated provider file:

```dart lib/auth_provider.dart
final corbadoProvider = Provider<CorbadoAuth>(
    (ref) => throw UnimplementedError("no instance of corbadoAuth"));
```

Next, we need to initialize CorbadoAuth and configure the provider:

```dart lib/main.dart
final corbadoAuth = CorbadoAuth();
  await corbadoAuth.init(projectId: projectId);
 
  // Finally we override the providers that needed initialization.
  // Now the real app can be loaded.
  runApp(ProviderScope(
    overrides: [
      corbadoProvider.overrideWithValue(corbadoAuth),
    ],
    child: const MyApp(),
  ));
```

Ensure the provider is correctly initialized within your app's state management solution, such as Riverpod.

## 3. Implement authentication flow

We use a provider to handle authentication state and access user information:

```dart lib/auth_provider.dart
final userProvider = StreamProvider<User?>((ref) async* {
  final corbado = ref.watch(corbadoProvider);
  await for (final value in corbado.userChanges) {
    yield value;
  }
});
```

```dart lib/auth_provider.dart
final authStateProvider = StreamProvider((ref) async* {
  final corbado = ref.watch(corbadoProvider);
  await for (final value in corbado.authStateChanges) {
    yield value;
  }
});
```

To manage user navigation, we need to set up routing that is aware of authentication status. Here is an example using go_router:

```dart lib/router.dart
final routerProvider = Provider<GoRouter>((ref) {
  final authState = ref.watch(authStateProvider);
 
  return GoRouter(
      initialLocation: Routes.auth,
      routes: [
        _defaultTransitionGoRoute(
          path: Routes.auth,
          builder: (context, state) => AuthPage(),
        ),
        _defaultTransitionGoRoute(
          path: Routes.profile,
          builder: (context, state) => ProfilePage(),
        ),
        _defaultTransitionGoRoute(
          path: Routes.editProfile,
          builder: (context, state) => EditProfilePage(),
        ),
        _defaultTransitionGoRoute(
          path: Routes.passkeyList,
          builder: (context, state) => PasskeyListPage(),
        ),
      ],
      redirect: (BuildContext context, GoRouterState state) {
        final onLoggedOutRoutes = [
          Routes.auth,
        ].contains(state.fullPath);
 
        if (authState.value == null) {
          return null;
        }
 
        switch (authState.value!) {
          case AuthState.None:
          // if the user is not logged in but currently on a page that should
          // only be visible for logged in users => redirect to signIn page.
            if (!onLoggedOutRoutes) {
              return Routes.auth;
            }
          case AuthState.SignedIn:
          // if the user is logged in but currently on a page that should
          // only be visible for logged out users => redirect to profile page.
            if (onLoggedOutRoutes) {
              return Routes.profile;
            }
        }
 
        return null;
      });
});
```

Corbado's authentication flow requires handling user navigation based on authentication state. The routing configuration ensures that:

- **Unauthenticated users** are redirected to the authentication screen (`/auth`).
- **Authenticated users** are redirected to the profile screen (`/profile`).
- Users cannot access restricted pages unless they are logged in.

The redirect logic ensures:

- If a user is **not signed in** and tries to access a protected route, they are sent to `/auth`.
- If a user is **already signed in** but tries to access `/auth`, they are redirected to `/profile` instead.

This behavior is handled within the `redirect` function in the routing setup:

```dart lib/router.dart
redirect: (BuildContext context, GoRouterState state) {
        final onLoggedOutRoutes = [
          Routes.auth,
        ].contains(state.fullPath);
 
        if (authState.value == null) {
          return null;
        }
 
        switch (authState.value!) {
          case AuthState.None:
          // if the user is not logged in but currently on a page that should
          // only be visible for logged in users => redirect to signIn page.
            if (!onLoggedOutRoutes) {
              return Routes.auth;
            }
          case AuthState.SignedIn:
          // if the user is logged in but currently on a page that should
          // only be visible for logged out users => redirect to profile page.
            if (onLoggedOutRoutes) {
              return Routes.profile;
            }
        }
 
        return null;
      });
```

## 4. Create authentication screens

To display the authentication UI, `CorbadoAuthComponent` is used, which internally manages authentication flows such as signup, login, and passkey handling. The `corbadoAuth` provider is accessed using Riverpod:

```dart lib/pages/auth_page.dart
final corbadoAuth = ref.watch(corbadoProvider);
```

The authentication screen is implemented using `CorbadoAuthComponent`, handling user interactions:

```dart lib/pages/auth_page.dart
CorbadoAuthComponent(
                  corbadoAuth: corbadoAuth,
                  components: CorbadoScreens(
                    signupInit: SignupInitScreen.new,
                    loginInit: LoginInitScreen.new,
                    emailVerifyOtp: EmailVerifyOtpScreen.new,
                    passkeyAppend: PasskeyAppendScreen.new,
                    passkeyVerify: PasskeyVerifyScreen.new,
                    emailEdit: EmailEditScreen.new,
                  ),
                ),
```

After successful login, users are redirected to their profile. This page provides basic user information and allows users to sign out.

The profile screen can include:

- A welcome message displaying the authenticated user's details.
- A sign-out button to log the user out and return to the authentication screen.

## 5. Handle Corbado screens

Corbado authentication is structured into multiple screens, each corresponding to a different part of the authentication flow. These screens are implemented using `CorbadoScreen<T>`, where `T` represents a supported Corbado block containing the required logic. Corbado automatically manages routing between these screens internally.

For a deeper understanding of how these blocks work, we will go through each in the next steps.

## 6. Set up Flutter Web

For Flutter web applications, include the Corbado JavaScript bundle in your `index.html`:

```html web/index.html
<script
    src="https://github.com/corbado/flutter-passkeys/releases/download/2.4.0/bundle.js"
    type="application/javascript"
></script>
```

Check the [index.html example](https://github.com/corbado/example-passkeys-flutter/blob/main/web/index.html) for reference.
