title: 'Making Requests'
description: 'When your app makes requests to your backend, it must authenticate itself by including the session-token as a header of these requests. The backend can then validate the session-token and decide if the client (your app) is allowed to make that request.'
---

The session-token is created after successful login and is provided to you by CorbadoAuth through _userChanges_. We can access it through the _userProvider_ we created in the previous `Overview` step.

<a href="/corbado-complete/sessions/session-token-handling" target="_blank"><Info >For more information on
    session-token handling, we highly recommend consulting our documentation.</Info></a>

Here is a brief example of how to include the session-token in your requests to your backend (e.g. https://www.corbado.com):

```dart lib/pages/edit_profile_page.dart
// This is only an example for demonstrations purposes
    Future<void> makeRequest() async {
      final url = Uri.parse('https://www.corbado.com');
 
      final response = await http.get(
        url,
        headers: {
          'Authorization': 'Bearer ${user.value!.idToken}',
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
      );
    }
```
