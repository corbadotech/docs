When adding passkeys to your Flutter app, you'll need to support several user flows:

- **Sign up** and **log in** with a passkey
- Provide **fallback options** when passkeys aren’t available
- Prompt users to **create a passkey** if they don’t have one yet

Managing when and how these screens appear requires quite a bit of logic.
**Corbado** simplifies this by offering:

- A service that handles this logic for you
- A developer panel to configure screen flows ([Settings \> User Interface](https://app.corbado.com/settings/userinterface?tab=Overview))
- Full flexibility to build your **own custom UI**

To make implementation easy, we introduced **Corbado Blocks**. Each block (e.g., `SignupInitBlock`) defines:

- The **data** available for a screen
- The **functionality** you can trigger

Next, we’ll walk you through each block and show how to implement them in your Flutter app.
