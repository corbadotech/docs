When adding passkeys to your Flutter app, you'll need to support several user flows:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Sign Up Flow" icon="user-plus">
    Create a new account using passkey authentication
  </Card>
  <Card title="Login Flow" icon="key">
    Access your account using passkey authentication
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fallback Options" icon="shield">
    Alternative login methods when passkeys aren't available
  </Card>
  <Card title="Passkey Creation" icon="fingerprint">
    Set up a new passkey for your account
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Managing these authentication flows requires handling various scenarios and user interactions. **Corbado** simplifies this process by providing:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Authentication Service" icon="server">
    A service that handles the authentication logic for you
  </Card>
  <Card title="Developer Panel" icon="table-columns">
    Configure screen flows in [Settings > User Interface](https://app.corbado.com/settings/userinterface?tab=Overview)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Custom UI" icon="brush">
    Full flexibility to build your own custom UI
  </Card>
  <Card title="Corbado Blocks" icon="puzzle">
    Each block (e.g., `SignupInitBlock`) defines the data and functionality available for a screen
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

To make implementation easy, we've organized the authentication flow into modular blocks. Each block represents a specific part of the authentication process and provides the necessary data and functionality to build your custom UI.

Next, we'll walk you through each block and show how to implement them in your Flutter app.
