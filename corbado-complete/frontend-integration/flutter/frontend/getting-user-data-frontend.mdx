title: 'Getting User Data'
description: 'Getting user data is simple and fast. Since the Corbado session-token is implemented as a JWT, we can get certain user data from the JWT claims directly. Our SDK takes care of this:'

<Warning>The Corbado provider must be integrated for this to work. Go Back to [Initialize Corbado](/corbado-complete/frontend-integration/flutter/frontend/frontend-integration#2-initialize-corbado)</Warning>

## Accessing User Data
<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the User Provider">
    The `CorbadoUserProvider` supplies various user details.

    ```dart lib/pages/profile_page.dart
    final user = ref.watch(userProvider);
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access User Properties">
    Once you have the user provider, you can access the user data everywhere in your app:
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Username">
        The `username` of the user (full name):

        ```dart lib/pages/edit_profile_page.dart
        final fullName = useTextEditingController(text: user.value!.username);
        ```
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Email">
        The `email` of the user (the identifier):

        ```dart lib/pages/edit_profile_page.dart
        final email = useTextEditingController(text: user.value!.email);
        ```
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Authentication Token">
        The `idToken` (session-token) used to authenticate the user:

        ```dart lib/pages/edit_profile_page.dart
        'Authorization': 'Bearer ${user.value!.idToken}',
        ```
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Step>
</Steps>
