title: "Configure xCode"

To begin, let's introduce some key concepts:

<CardGroup>
    <Card title="Bundle Identifier">
        This is a unique identifier assigned to your app, typically in reverse domain name notation (e.g., com.yourcompany.yourapp). It ensures that no two apps share the same identifier.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Team ID">
        An Apple Developer Team ID is a unique 10-character alphanumeric identifier assigned by Apple to your development team.
    </Card>
</CardGroup>
<Card title="App ID">
    This identifier comprises a Team ID (assigned by Apple to your development team) and a Bundle Identifier search string. It associates your app with specific services and capabilities, such as push notifications or iCloud or more importantly for us the associated domains.
</Card>

## 1. xCode setup

We need to configure a few settings in Xcode:

![Xcode Configuration](/images/frontend-integration/flutter/xcode-signing-capabilities.webp)

<Steps>
    <Step title="Open your project in Xcode">
        - Navigate to your flutter project directory in Finder then to your `ios` directory
        - Open `Runner.xcworkspace`
    </Step>
    <Step title="Go to Signing & Capabilities">
        Go to the **Signing & Capabilities** tab
    </Step>
    <Step title="Select your Apple ID account">
        Under **Team**, select your Apple ID account
        <Note>If you haven't added your Apple ID yet, click **"Add Account..."**, log in, and select it</Note>
        <Warning>Choose an account that is part of the **Apple Developer Program**</Warning>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Set Bundle Identifier">
        Set a **unique Bundle Identifier** for your app
        - For example: `com.yourname.myapp`
        <Note>This needs to be globally unique across all apps in the App Store</Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Enable automatic signing">
        Check `Automatically manage signing` so Xcode takes care of configuring everything for you
    </Step>
</Steps>


## 2. Register your device

Xcode needs to register your iPhone as a development device:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Connect your iPhone">
        Connect your iPhone to your Mac via a USB cable
    </Step>
    <Step title="Trust the computer">
        If it is the first time you connect, you may need to tap **"Trust this computer"** on your iPhone and enter your passcode
    </Step>
    <Step title="Select run target">
        In the top bar, select your connected iPhone from the device list as the run target
    </Step>
    <Step title="Register device">
        If this is your first time using the device for development, Xcode will register it automatically
        <Warning>Sometimes you need to replug your device for the registration to complete</Warning>
    </Step>
</Steps>
