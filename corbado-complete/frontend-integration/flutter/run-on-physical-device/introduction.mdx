In the first part of this guide, we focused on a quick and easy setup to get the example project running in a **simulator or emulator**. This helped you get familiar with the basics without needing to configure anything complex.

Now, we’re taking the **next step**: running the app on a **physical device** using **your own Corbado project**. This is essential when preparing for real-world testing, debugging device-specific issues and getting closer to production.

For **iOS**, this step comes with a bit more complexity compared to the simulator — due to code signing, provisioning profiles, and device registration. But don’t worry: we walk you through **all common pitfalls** and explain every step **in detail**, so you won’t get stuck.

Let’s dive in!
