To run on your device you will need to:

    1. Enable `Developer options` on android. [How to enable developer options](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options).
    2. Enable USB debugging/wireless debugging in the `Developer option` 
    3. Connect your phone with Android Studio.

With that everything is configured, itâ€™s time to run your Flutter app on your Android Device. Make sure your device is still connected and unlocked. Then, in your terminal, run:

```bash
flutter run lib/main.dart
```

Congratulations, you have successfully completed the Android setup for your Flutter app!
