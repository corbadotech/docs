## Quick Start Guide

Let's get you up and running with a local example. Follow these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Set Up Your Development Environment">
1. **Install Required Tools**:
   - [Xcode](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos#ios-setup) (for iOS development)
   - [Android Studio](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (for Android development)
   - [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

2. **Verify Your Setup**:
   Run the following command to ensure everything is properly configured:
   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```
</Step>

<Step title="Get the Example Code">
Clone our example repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/corbado/example-passkeys-flutter.git
```
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Your Emulators">
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="iOS Simulator Setup">
    1. Open the iOS Simulator
    2. Enable biometric authentication:
       - Go to **Features → Face ID / Touch ID → Enrolled**
       - Test authentication using **Features → Face ID / Touch ID → Matching Face / Matching Touch**
       - **Pro Tip:** Use `Command + Shift + M` for Face ID or `Command + Shift + H` for Touch ID simulation
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Android Emulator Setup">
    1. Launch Android Studio and open the AVD Manager
    2. Ensure your emulator is running API level 30 or higher
    3. Complete these steps in the emulator:
       - Set up a Google account (required for passkeys)
       - Enable PIN/password in `Settings → Security`
       - Configure fingerprint authentication in `Settings → Security → Fingerprint`

    <Note>**Pro Tip:** Simulate fingerprint with: `adb emu finger touch <finger_id>`</Note>
