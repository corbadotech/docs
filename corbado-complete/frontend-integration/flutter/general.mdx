## Overview

The [corbado_auth](https://github.com/corbado/flutter-passkeys/tree/main/packages/corbado_auth) package provides an authentication SDK that fully integrates with Corbado's relying party server. Therefore, `corbado_auth` is the easiest way to add passkeys to your Flutter app. All you need to do is to set up your Corbado project and install `corbado_auth`.

**Supported platforms**: Android, iOS, Web

With `corbado_auth` you can:

- sign up and login users with [passkeys](https://www.corbado.com/glossary/passkey)
- login users with [Conditional UI](https://www.corbado.com/glossary/conditional-ui)
- use email one-time passcodes (OTP) as a [fallback](/corbado-complete/helpful-guides/passkeys/fallback-options) mechanism for cases when passkeys cannot be used

## 1. Prerequisites

<Note>
Please see the [pub.dev page](https://pub.dev/packages/corbado_auth) for the latest prerequisites of the `corbado_auth` Flutter package.
</Note>

First, you need to set up a [Corbado project](/corbado-complete/overview/getting-started).

Start by cloning our GitHub example repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/corbado/example-passkeys-flutter.git
```

## 2. Running the example

First, we need to install the iOS Simulator and the Android Emulator:

- **Xcode / iOS Simulator:**
  Follow the [official Flutter guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos#ios-setup) to install Xcode and configure the iOS Simulator.

- **Android Studio / Emulator:**
  Follow the [official Flutter guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) to install Android Studio and set up the Android Emulator.

> Please make sure you're using the latest versions of both Xcode and Android Studio.

Next, we verify that the local development environment is properly configured:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

To enable passkeys, we need to configure both the iOS Simulator and the Android Emulator:

- **iOS Simulator:**
  To enable Touch ID (on older versions) or Face ID, use the iOS Simulator menu:

    - **Features â†’ Face ID / Touch ID â†’ Enrolled**
    - Trigger authentication using **Features â†’ Face ID / Touch ID â†’ Matching Face / Matching Touch**

        **_Note:_** Simulate Face ID: `Command + Shift + M` / Simulate Touch ID: `Command + Shift + H`

- **Android Emulator:**
  Configure Passkeys by setting up a Google account and PIN:

    1. Open Android Studio and launch the AVD Manager.
    2. Select your emulator and ensure it's running API level 30 or higher.
    3. Set up a Google account on the emulator (needed for passkeys).
    4. Enable a PIN or password under `Settings â†’ Security`.
    5. Enable Fingerprint authentication in `Settings â†’ Security â†’ Fingerprint`.

        **_Note:_** To simulate fingerprint authentication, you can use this command in the terminal:

        ```bash
        adb emu finger touch <finger_id>
        ```

    In case of issues during setup, please check this Troubleshooting Guide for further information: [Corbado Troubleshooting Guide](https://www.corbado.com/blog/flutter-passkeys-package#android-screen-lock-not-set-up-on-virtual-android-device)

### Running the Example

Finally, we can run the Flutter application by executing this command in the terminal:

```bash
flutter run lib/main.dart
```
