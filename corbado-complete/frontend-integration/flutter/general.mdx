## Welcome to Corbado's Flutter Integration Guide

This guide will help you integrate passkey authentication into your Flutter applications using Corbado's official Flutter package. Whether you're building for Android, iOS, or Web, we've got you covered with a comprehensive solution for modern authentication.

### What You'll Learn

- How to set up passkey authentication in your Flutter app
- How to implement sign-up and login flows
- How to use Conditional UI for seamless authentication
- How to handle fallback authentication methods

### See It in Action

Before diving into the implementation, check out these live examples:

- ðŸ”— **[Live Demo (Flutter Web)](https://corbadoauth.flutter.corbado.io)**
  A fully functional example deployed on Vercel.

- ðŸ“± **Official Corbado App**
  Our production-ready Flutter app:
    - [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/corbado-developer-panel/id6468424589)
    - [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.corbado.developerpanel.app)

## Quick Start Guide

Let's get you up and running with a local example. Follow these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Set Up Your Development Environment">
1. **Install Required Tools**:
   - [Xcode](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos#ios-setup) (for iOS development)
   - [Android Studio](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (for Android development)
   - [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

2. **Verify Your Setup**:
   Run the following command to ensure everything is properly configured:
   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```
</Step>

<Step title="Get the Example Code">
Clone our example repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/corbado/example-passkeys-flutter.git
```
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Your Emulators">
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="iOS Simulator Setup">
    1. Open the iOS Simulator
    2. Enable biometric authentication:
       - Go to **Features â†’ Face ID / Touch ID â†’ Enrolled**
       - Test authentication using **Features â†’ Face ID / Touch ID â†’ Matching Face / Matching Touch**
       - **Pro Tip:** Use `Command + Shift + M` for Face ID or `Command + Shift + H` for Touch ID simulation
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Android Emulator Setup">
    1. Launch Android Studio and open the AVD Manager
    2. Ensure your emulator is running API level 30 or higher
    3. Complete these steps in the emulator:
       - Set up a Google account (required for passkeys)
       - Enable PIN/password in `Settings â†’ Security`
       - Configure fingerprint authentication in `Settings â†’ Security â†’ Fingerprint`

    <Note>**Pro Tip:** Simulate fingerprint with: `adb emu finger touch <finger_id>`</Note>
