title: 'New file'
description: 'Description of your new file.'

This block is used to initiate a sign up. The goal of this block is to ask the user for a unique identifier (currently only email is supported) and an optional name (we call this a fullname at Corbado). The corresponding screen will thus be shown when a user starts a new signup in your app.

### Screen

First, we create a new screen implementing the `SignupInitBlock`:

scr signup_init_block_constructor

Then we add a `TextField` input for the email with its controller:

scr signup_init_email_controller

scr signup_init_email_textfield

Finally, we add two buttons for navigating to Login and submission:

scr signup_init_fallback

scr signup_init_submit

### Available block data

Stores signup initialization details like `fullName`, `email`, and `primaryLoading`.

### Available block methods

- `navigateToLogin()`: Redirects users to the login screen.
- `submitSignupInit({String? email, String? fullName}) async`: Initiates the signup process with optional email and full name.

scr signup_init
