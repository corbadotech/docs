<Warning>
    Before we can begin to render the Corbado Authentication UI, the `CorbadoProvider` has to be integrated.
    Find more [here](/corbado-complete/frontend-integration/react).
</Warning>

## Integration

The Authentication UI allows the user to log in or register with Corbado.
Once the user is logged in, the `onLoggedIn` callback is executed.

```tsx components/Auth.tsx
import { CorbadoAuth } from "@corbado/react";

export default function Auth() {
    const onLoggedIn = () => {
        //post login actions like navigation can be performed here.
        console.log("User is logged in");
    };

    return <CorbadoAuth onLoggedIn={onLoggedIn} />;
}
```

## Next

Let your users manage their passkeys with the [PasskeyList](/corbado-complete/frontend-integration/react/passkeylist).
