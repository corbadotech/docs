title: "Protecting Routes"
description: "This pages explains how to protect routes of your application by using the session-token."

As previously explained, the **session-token** is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (**JWT**). To protect routes, you need to validate the **session-token** by performing a **JWT** verification. This allows you to verify user authentication and take the appropriate actions.

Corbado provides SDKs to simplify this process. Please see our [integration guides](https://app.corbado.com/getting-started) for different programming languages and frameworks.
