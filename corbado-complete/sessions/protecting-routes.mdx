As previously explained, the **session-token** is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (**JWT**). To protect routes, you need to validate the **session-token** by performing a **JWT** verification. This allows you to verify user authentication and take the appropriate actions.

Corbado simplifies this process by providing Integration Guides and Backend SDKs for a variety of programming languages and frameworks:
