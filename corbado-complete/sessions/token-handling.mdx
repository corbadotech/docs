When a user logs in into your application, the UI component stores the **session-token** as a cookie. Since user authentication is determined by the **session-token** (see [Protecting Routes](./protecting-routes)), it must be accessible wherever you need to verify the user's authentication status.

By default, the `Domain` of the **session-token** cookie is set to the domain the UI component is integrated on (e.g. the UI component is integrated on https://www.example.com/auth/ the `Domain` will be www.example.com).

The following scenarios can happen (which result in different cookie availability):

### 1) Frontend and backend are on the same domain

- Frontend runs on https://www.example.com
- User logs in using the Corbado UI component
- The **session-token** is created and stored as cookie with name `cbo_session_token` and `Domain=www.example.com`
- User interacts and frontend (JavaScript) sends requests to the backend on https://www.example.com/api
- The **session-token** cookie is sent with the request to the backend because the `Domain` matches
- Backend reads **session-token** from cookie `cbo_session_token` and validates it

### 2) Frontend and backend are on different domains

- Frontend runs on https://www.example.com
- User logs in using the Corbado UI component
- The **session-token** is created and stored as cookie with name `cbo_session_token` and `Domain=www.example.com`
- User interacts and frontend (JavaScript) sends requests to the backend on https://www.example.com/api
- The **session-token** cookie is sent with the request to the backend because the `Domain` matches
- Backend reads **session-token** from cookie `cbo_session_token` and validates it

### 3) Frontend and multiples backends are on different domains
