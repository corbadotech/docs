description: "Learn how to use your own session management while using Corbado's passkey authentication solution."

<Warning>
The following documentation provides a detailed explanation how Corbado can be used with your own session management. If you build a new application without existing users, we strongly recommend to use [Corbado's session management](/corbado-complete/sessions/overview), as this will save you a lot of implementation time and is a proven solution.

To **use your own session management**, you have to **switch the toggle** in the Corbado developer panel [Settings > Sessions](https://app.corbado.com/settings/sessions).
</Warning>

## Overview

In the following, we'll outline the step-by-step implementation of your own session management.

<Steps>
    <Step title="User logs in to your application">
        The user logs into your application using our [UI Components](/corbado-complete/ui-components).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Corbado backend creates JWT token">
        Upon successful login, the Corbado [Frontend API](/corbado-complete/overview/corbado-api-structure/frontend-api) responds with a
        [short-term session JWT](/corbado-complete/sessions/overview#short-term-session-represented-as-jwt).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Request a session from your application">
        After receiving the **Corbado short-term session**, the user sends a request to **your backend**
        including the **Corbado short-term session** either as a cookie or in an authorization header.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Validate the Corbado short-term session in your backend">
        **Your backend** must verify the **Corbado short-term** session to be authentic. This can be done either by using
        a dedicated [Corbado backend SDK](/corbado-complete/overview/welcome#backend-integration) or manually using our [JWKS](https://apireference.cloud.corbado.io/frontendapi-v1/#tag/Sessions/operation/WellKnownJWKSList).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create your own session">
        After confirming that the **Corbado short-term** session is authentic, so you can create **your own session** in the backend.
        Then, send your session to the user.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Store and use your own session">
        After the user receives your session, he can store it in any way you prefer (e.g. cookie or localstorage).
        Moving forward, it's up to you how to handle your own session and what properties it should have.
    </Step>
