In the following, we'll outline the step-by-step implementation of how to connect your own session management with the Corbado session management:

<Steps>
    <Step title="User logs in to your application">
        The user logs into your application using our [UI Components](/corbado-complete/ui-components).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Corbado backend creates session-token">
        Upon successful login, the Corbado [Frontend API](/corbado-complete/overview/system-architecture#corbado-frontend-api) responds with a
        [session-token](/corbado-complete/sessions/overview#session-token).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Request a session from your application">
        After receiving the **Corbado session-token**, the user sends a request to **your backend**
        including the **Corbado session-token** either as a cookie or in an authorization header.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Validate the Corbado session-token in your backend">
        **Your backend** must verify the **Corbado session-token** to be authentic. This can be done either by using
        a dedicated [Corbado backend SDK](/corbado-complete/overview/welcome#backend-integration) or manually using our JWKS (https://< projectID >.frontendapi.cloud.corbado.io/.well-known/jwks).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create your own session">
        After confirming that the **Corbado session-token** is authentic, so you can create **your own session** in the backend.
        Then, send your session to the user.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Store and use your own session">
        After the user receives your session, he can store it in any way you prefer (e.g. cookie or localstorage).
        Moving forward, it's up to you how to handle your own session and what properties it should have.
    </Step>
