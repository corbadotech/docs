description: "In the following, the lifetime and inactivity values you can define with Corbado session management are explained"

## Maximum lifetime for the short-term session

This value defines the lifetime of the **short-term** session (represented as JWT). Shortly before the timeout, the **short-term** session (represented as **JWT**) cookie is refreshed. This refresh uses the **long-term** session (represented as session ID and database entry) cookie.

| Minimum value | Default value | Maximum value |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| 1 minute     | 30 minutes       | 60 minutes        |

<Note>
We recommend to keep the value for the **short-term** session (represented as **JWT**) rather short, as users do not notice the refresh and payload of the refresh is relatively low.
</Note>

## Maximum lifetime for the long-term session

This value defines the lifetime of the **long-term** session (represented as session ID and database entry). In general, you can consider this value to be the overall session duration perceived of your users.

This value must be **larger than** the **maximum lifetime** for the **short-term** session (represented as **JWT**) and **larger than** the **inactivity timeout** for the **long-term** session (represented as session ID and database entry).


| Minimum value | Default value | Maximum value |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| 5 minutes     | 30 days        | 10 years        |

<Note>
Defining the length of the maximum lifetime of the **long-term** session (represented as session ID and database entry) depends a lot on your product and its users.&#x20;

For greater user experience, a larger value is recommended, while a smaller value is better for security hygiene.
</Note>

## Inactivity timeout for the long-term session

This value defines the time that can pass without a user activity before the user is automatically logged out, regardless of whether the **long-term** session (represented as session ID and database entry) is still active.

Since the **short-term** session (represented as **JWT**) is validated client-side without any server requests to Corbado, the only way to measure activity is by updating it upon [session refresh](/corbado-complete/sessions/other/refresh). For instance, no additional activity is recorded if the user simply closes the browser (without logging out) or experiences a loss of internet connection.

This value must be **smaller than** the **maximum lifetime** for the **long-term** session (represented as session ID and database entry) and **larger than** the **maximum lifetime** for the **short-term** session (represented as **JWT**).

| Minimum value | Default value | Maximum value |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| 5 minutes     | 5 days        | 1 year        |


<Note>
Defining the length of the inactivity of the **long-term** session (represented as session ID and database entry) depends a lot on your product and its users.&#x20;

For greater user experience, a larger value is recommended, as users stay logged in even after a longer time of inactivity.

For better security hygiene, a smaller value is recommended.
