# Cookie security

On successful authentication, the Corbado [Frontend API](/corbado-complete/overview/system-architecture#corbado-frontend-api) sets the following cookies:

| Type                   | Name              | Value                      | Path                                                                    | Attributes                         | Default duration |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **session-token**      | cbo_session_token | JWT                        | [Application URL](/corbado-complete/helpful-guides/url-overview#2-application-url)    | `secure` `sameSite=lax`            | 5 mins           |
| **refresh-token**      | cbo_refresh_token | Opaque string              | [Frontend API](/corbado-complete/overview/system-architecture#corbado-frontend-api) | `httpOnly` `secure` `sameSite=lax` | 1 day            |

Both the **session-token** and the **refresh-token** cookies are set with the `secure` flag, which ensures that they can only be accessed on secure internet connections.

The properties of `httpOnly` and `sameSite` will be explained in the following sections on [**XSS** protection](./xss-protection) and [**CSRF** protection](./csrf-protection), respectively. These sections provide further details on how these properties contribute to safeguarding against specific types of attacks.

<Note>
According to [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/cookies/), users are not required to give explicit consent for your application to use session cookies. Session cookies are considered essential cookies, not tracking cookies.
</Note>

By default, the cookies are **not** set as wildcard cookies (e.g., \*.acme.com). This ensures that, for example, they are not sent to external CDN hosts (e.g., cdn1.acme.com). Avoiding wildcard cookies is considered a good practice.&#x20;
