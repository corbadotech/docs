The **short-term** session (represented as **JWT**) has a limited validity period and requires refreshing. To accomplish this, the refresh logic, written in JavaScript, must be integrated into your frontend. The logic consists of two main components: the [session watcher](#session-watcher) and the [refresh routine](#refresh-routine).

## Session watcher

The session watcher checks every 10 seconds if there exists a **short-term** session (represented as **JWT**) cookie. If so, it starts the [refresh routine](#refresh-routine).

## Refresh routine

In order to refresh the **short-term** session (represented as **JWT**), 60 seconds before the **short-term** session
expires, a refresh will be triggered. This refresh fetches a new **JWT** from the [Frontend API](/corbado-complete/overview/corbado-api-structure/frontend-api). On this fetch, the **long-term** session (represented as session ID with database entry) cookie gets transferred and the refresh routine issues a new **short-term** session (represented as **JWT)** for you.

In case there is no internet connection, it tries every ten seconds to refresh the **short-term** session (represented as **JWT**).
