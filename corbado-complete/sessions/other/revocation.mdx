The combination of a **session-token** and a session database entry provides a convenient method for revoking sessions.

Revoking a session involves deleting the corresponding session entry from the Corbado database. You can accomplish this easily through the developer panel by accessing the [session list](https://app.corbado.com/app/sessions).

<Info>
Technically speaking, the session will persist until the **session-token** expires. Thus the revocation/logout will be delayed to a maximum of the **session-token** lifetime.
