It is important to understand that Corbado does neither operate as an **OAuth2** server nor does it strictly follow the **OAuth2** protocol. **OAuth2** primarily focuses on authorizing third-party access to resources. In contrast, Corbado offers a simpler yet highly secure authentication solution.

However, if you are familiar with **OAuth2**, you will find some similarities. The **session-token** serves a similar purpose as the access-token in **OAuth2**. The **refresh-token** serves the same purpose as in **OAuth2**: to refresh the **session-token** (access-token).
