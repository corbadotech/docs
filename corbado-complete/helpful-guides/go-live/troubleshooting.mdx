## Browser Console Error: JSON Web Key Set Malformed

If you encounter the "JSON Web Key Set Malformed" error in the browser console after go live, it means that you probably haven't set the [CNAME](/corbado-complete/helpful-guides/url-overview#5-cname) for [Corbado's session management](/corbado-complete/sessions/overview) correctly. Please check the [CNAME setting in the developer panel](https://app.corbado.com/app/settings/general/go-live) if the CNAME is correctly set and refresh your browser.
