title: "Fallback Options"
description: "For non-passkey-ready devices or users not wanting to use passkeys, fallback options must be implemented."

## Why do we need fallback options?

Fallback options are crucial for a few key reasons:

1. **Device compatibility**: Despite a growing number of devices being passkey-ready (as detailed in [our analysis](https://www.corbado.com/blog/september-2023-update-insights-passkey-readiness) and the [passkeys analyzer](https://www.corbado.com/passkeys/analyzer)), there will always be users with devices that do not support this technology.
2. **User preference**: Some users might choose not to use passkeys, even on compatible devices, due to personal preferences or specific requirements.
3. **Inclusivity**: Providing diverse login methods ensures that every user, regardless of their device or preference, has access to a secure and convenient way to log in.

## What fallback options are supported by Corbado?

Corbado offers a range of fallback options, catering to different user needs and technological capabilities:

-   **Corbado Complete**: For users of Corbado Complete, we focus exclusively on passwordless fallbacks. These include:
    -   Email magic links
    -   Email one-time passcodes (OTPs)
    -   SMS OTPs
    -   Social logins (Google, Microsoft, GitHub and soon more)
-   **Corbado Connect**: If you opt for Corbado Connect, there's flexibility to fall back to traditional password-based authentication systems.

## How does Corbado handle fallbacks?

Corbado employs a 'passkey-first' principle, which prioritizes passkey logins whenever feasible:

-   **Promoting passkey logins**: When a user has the option, passkey login is presented as the primary authentication method.
-   **Sophisticated passkey intelligence and detection**: Our system intelligently detects the passkey-readiness of different users on various devices.
-   **Seamless transition to alternatives**: If our system determines that passkeys are not a viable option, it smoothly transitions to offering alternative methods.
