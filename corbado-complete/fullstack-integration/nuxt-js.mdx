## Installation

<Installation />

## Set up Corbado

As a prerequisite to all future actions, Corbado has to be loaded.
We do this by using the [Corbado.load()](/corbado-complete/fullstack-integration/nuxt-js) function.
We also maintain a global state, indicating whether Corbado is successfully loaded.

```html layouts/default.vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import Corbado from "@corbado/web-js"
import {onMounted} from "vue";

const isCorbadoLoaded = useState('isCorbadoLoaded', () => false)

onMounted(async () => {
    await Corbado.load({
        projectId: "pro-XXX",
        darkMode: "off"
    })
    isCorbadoLoaded.value = true
})

provide('isCorbadoLoaded', isCorbadoLoaded)
</script>

<template>
    <slot/>
</template>
```

<CorbadoProviderReference isWebJS={true} />

## Next

1. Add [authentication UI components](/corbado-complete/fullstack-integration/nuxt-js/corbadoauth) to your application.
2. Let your users manage their passkeys with the [PasskeyList](/corbado-complete/fullstack-integration/nuxt-js/passkeylist).
3. Learn how you can access the users authentication state on the [client-side](/corbado-complete/fullstack-integration/nuxt-js/authentication-state-client).
4. Easily [access user information on the server-side](/corbado-complete/fullstack-integration/nuxt-js/authentication-state-server)
with the [Node.js SDK](/corbado-complete/backend-integration/node-js-sdk).
