<Warning>
    Before we can begin to render the Corbado PasskeyList, the `Corbado.load()` call has to resolve.
    Find more [here](/fullstack-integration/nuxt-js).
</Warning>

## Integration

The Passkeylist allows the user to view and manage their passkeys.
He can delete existing passkeys or create new ones.
This can be useful if the user wants to have individual passkeys for multiple devices, or erase ones
that are no longer needed.

```html pages/profile.vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import Corbado from "@corbado/web-js"
import {watchEffect} from "vue";

const isCorbadoLoaded = inject('isCorbadoLoaded') as Ref<boolean>
const passkeyListElement = ref<HTMLDivElement>()

watchEffect(() => {
    if (passkeyListElement.value && isCorbadoLoaded.value) {
        Corbado.mountPasskeyListUI(passkeyListElement.value)
    }
})
</script>

<template>
    <div ref="passkeyListElement"></div>
</template>
```
