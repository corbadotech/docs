<Warning>
    Before we can begin to render the Corbado Authentication UI, the `CorbadoProvider` has to be integrated.
    Find more [here](/corbado-complete/fullstack-integration/next-js).
</Warning>

## Integration

The Authentication UI allows the user to log in or register with Corbado.
Once the user is logged in, the `onLoggedIn` callback is executed.

```tsx app/auth/page.tsx
"use client";

import { CorbadoAuth } from "@corbado/react";
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";

export default function Page() {
    const router = useRouter();

    const onLoggedIn = () => {
        //post login actions can be performed here.
        router.push("/profile");
    };

    return <CorbadoAuth onLoggedIn={onLoggedIn} />;
}
```

<StylingTranslationCards />

## Next

Let your users manage their passkeys with the [PasskeyList](/corbado-complete/fullstack-integration/next-js/passkeylist).
