## Introduction

The `PasskeyList` component lists all passkeys that a user has created and that are available to them. The user can delete these existing passkeys or add new ones.

The `PasskeyList` component allows an application to add only one passkey per device.

You can embed this component in the user's profile page and thus give them control over their passkeys.
