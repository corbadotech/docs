Corbado offers multiple ways to customize the styling of the UI components. You can adjust the styling through the following settings:

-   [Configuring dark-mode](#configuring-dark-mode)
-   [Switching the theme](#switching-the-theme)
-   [Creating a custom theme](#creating-a-custom-theme)

### Configuring dark-mode

For every theme, there is styling for dark and for light mode. Which of these themes is applied depends on your configuration for the `darkMode` parameter in the `CorbadoProvider`.<br/> You can set the `darkMode` to `on|off|auto`. If set to `auto` the darkMode setting will be derived from the browser.

### Switching the theme

Currently, Corbado offers two themes out of the box:

- default
- emerald-funk

You can pass the theme to the `CorbadoProvider` `theme` setting (see your framework's integration guide for more details).
If no setting is passed, the default theme is used.
Currently, the only alternative theme is `emerald-funk`.

### Creating a custom theme

If you need more customization, you can create your own theme. To do so, create one parent CSS class named after your theme (e.g. "your-custom-theme").

Inside this class you can now overwrite all the Corbado classes. Every Corbado class is prefixed with "cb-" so you can easily identify them.

<Tip>
    If you want to change the styling of a particular part of the UI components
    but you don't know the classname, just use your browser's "inspect" tool
    from the developer tools.

```css Custome Theme
.your-custom-theme {
    --cb-box-color: #3f465d;
    --cb-primary-color-hover: #1145df80;
    --cb-primary-color-disabled: #6f7486;
    --cb-script-text-color: #d0d9f5;
    --cb-box-color-hover: #525d83;

    .cb-container {
        width: 500px;
    }

    .cb-error-popup {
        gap: 1rem;
        padding: 2rem 3rem;
    }
}
```

Finally, configure the `CorbadoProvider` component to use the theme:

<CodeGroup>
```tsx React
import { CorbadoProvider } from "@corbado/react";

const App = () => {
    return (
        <CorbadoProvider projectId="pro-XXX" theme="your-custom-theme">
            /** Your application **/
        </CorbadoProvider>
    );
};
```

```html Web-JS
<script type="module">
    Corbado.load({
        projectId: "pro-XXX",
        theme: "your-custom-theme"
    });
</script>
```

</CodeGroup>

## FAQs

### Dark mode customizations not loading in production

This can happen if your custom CSS is loading before the `.cb-dark` class from the Corbado package is loaded by the browser. It can be fixed by increasing the specificity of the custom class like with `.cb-dark.your-custom-theme`

### Icon colors not applied in `web-js` package when using `<script />` tag

We use the `windows.atob` function which decodes a string of Base64-encoded data into bytes. This is used to convert Base64 SVG images to HTML SVG elements and then apply custom styling to them.
In case of using `web-js` package with inline `<script />` tag this is not allowed by the browsers and thus customised colors cannot be applied to SVGs for now in these types of applications.
