## How to activate social logins
In the [Corbado developer panel](https://app.corbado.com), navigate to **Settings > User Interface > Social**.
Activate each provider that you want to use one-by-one.

**Note:**
To simplify development you can use shared OAuth credentials provided by Corbado.
Make sure to select "Corbado account" when you activate a provider if you want to use shared credentials.
The benefit for you as a developer is that you don't need to create your own OAuth credentials for each provider during development.

When you are ready to go live, you can and should switch to your own OAuth credentials.
