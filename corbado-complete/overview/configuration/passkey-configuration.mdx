## Introduction

These settings directly impact the passkey experience during sign-up and login and define what screens the user is going to see.

The following settings can be adapted in the Developer Panel in the **[Settings > User interface > Passkeys](https://app.corbado.com/settings/userinterface?tab=Passkeys)** page:

1. [Passkey pop-up frequency](/corbado-complete/overview/configuration/passkey-configuration#1-passkey-pop-up-frequency): Frequency for prompting users without a passkey to add one
2. [Cross-Device Authentication Strategy](/corbado-complete/overview/configuration/passkey-configuration#2-cross-device-authentication-strategy): What strategy should be used for Cross-Device Authentication

## 1. Passkey pop-up frequency

If a passkey is not created during the sign-up process, the user can be offered the option to append a passkey after logging using a fallback method.
This setting allows adjusting the frequency at which a user without a passkey is prompted to append one. The options range from every login to once every 3 months.

## 2. Cross-Device Authentication Strategy

[Cross-Device Authentication (CDA)](https://www.corbado.com/glossary/cda) allows users to use a passkey from one device (CDA authenticator) for authentication on another device (CDA client), facilitating seamless access across diverse platforms.

While the two involved devices can come in a lot of different combinations, the most popular one is a desktop computer accessing a website and a smartphone holding the passkey, and processing the actual authentication.

The Cross-Device Authentication strategy setting defines how Corbado's UI component behaves during sign-up and login:

<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Strategy</th>
        <th>Sign-up</th>
        <th>Login</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Minimize</td>
        <td>CDA is not offered during sign-up</td>
        <td>CDA cannot be used for login</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Standard (default)</td>
        <td>CDA is not offered during sign-up</td>
        <td>CDA can be used for login (e.g. using a passkey created directly on your smartphone)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Maximize</td>
        <td>CDA is the only shown option (e.g. via QR code & hardware security key)</td>
        <td>CDA can be used for login (e.g. using a passkey created directly on your smartphone)</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<Note>
    Since the CDA strategy is an advanced setting, we recommend leaving it at the default setting (**standard**). If you
