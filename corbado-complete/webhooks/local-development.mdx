## Overview

You can expose your local development environment to receive webhook events from Corbado using a tunneling service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) makes local web applications reachable over the internet with a single command.

Launch ngrok to connect it to your application and receive webhook events from Corbado.

Once ngrok is launched, you should receive a public URL that you can use to configure your webhook endpoint in the Corbado developer panel.
