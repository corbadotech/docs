Webhooks are a powerful way to integrate Corbado with your application. They allow you to receive near real-time notifications when specific events occur in Corbado rather than polling the API for changes.

Webhooks in Corbado operate on a *best-effort* basis. This means that Corbado will attempt to deliver webhook events to your server, but delivery is *not guaranteed*. If a webhook delivery fails, Corbado will automatically retry the delivery *up to two times* before stopping further attempts.

To ensure your system processes webhooks effectively:

- Your webhook handler should be designed to handle duplicate events safely, as retries may occur

- Webhooks should not be relied upon for mission-critical functionality since delivery is not guaranteed (e.g. your webhook endpoint was offline)
