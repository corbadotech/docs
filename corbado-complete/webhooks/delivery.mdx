Corbado allows you to subscribe to specific event types and receive near real-time notifications when these events occur by creating Webhook Endpoints. Each Webhook Endpoint needs a URL to which Corbado sends the event data, list of event types to subscribe to, optional basic authentication and custom headers to send with each request.

When an event is triggered, Corbado sends an HTTP `POST` request to the configured webhook URL if event type matches the subscription. The request includes a JSON payload with information about the event. Each webhook request has `Content-Type: application/json` header. Corbado also duplicates the event type in `X-Corbado-Webhook-Event` header to provide a type hint before event deserialization. Every webhook request is retried up to two times if the delivery fails. A failed delivery means that the webhook endpoint did not respond with a `2xx` status code or failed to respond at all.
