## Introduction

To get passkeys smoothly implemented, you need to adapt the following settings in the Corbado developer panel (not in your code):

* [Relying party ID](#relying-party-id)
* [Native app settings ](#native-app-settings)(only if you're using native apps)
* [Authorized origins](#authorized-origins) (for production deployments)
* [CNAME](#cname) (for production deployments)

For each of these settings, we provide recommendations on the specific setting during development and for production (+ provide examples).
