<Note>
    **Didn't find your framework?**<br/> If your project supports JavaScript, you can always use the [Vanilla JS](/frontend-integration/vanilla-js) UI-Components, regardless of your tech stack.<br/>(E.g project based on **PHP, Python ecc.**)
</Note>

## Configuration

In order to provide an optimal user experience, Corbado offers a wide range of configurations that can be adjusted both within the developer panel and directly within the UI-components themselves.

In the following chapter find all the information about the project [configuration](/overview/configuration).

{/*

## 1. Set up your Corbado account

[Sign up](https://app.corbado.com/signin#register) for a free Corbado account.&#x20;

![Developer panel Signup](/images/overview/getting-started/dev-panel-sign-up-2.webp)

After successful account creation, the Corbado developer panel opens and you can create a new project.



## 2. Create a new project

![Developer panel project selection](/images/overview/getting-started/dev-panel-project-selection.webp)

After clicking on "Create new project", a wizard appears that helps you to set up your project. After you've successfully set up your project, you should see the following screen:

![Developer panel project overview](/images/overview/getting-started/dev-panel-project-overview-2.webp)


## 3. Test your settings

The default settings are set so that the components can be tested directly in the preview. Click on the "preview" button (at the top) and a new tab will open in which the components are already built into an example page.

The following two configurations can be made that help you to implement passkeys smoothly.

- [User flow configuration](/overview/sign-up-and-login-with-passkeys/user-flow-configuration): this will impact the user authentication journey (which screens is the user going to see).
- [Passkey configuration](/overview/sign-up-and-login-with-passkeys/passkey-configuration): this will impact which apps and websites your users' passkeys can be used.

The settings changes can be seen in the preview tab.
