With Corbado, we want to enable every developer to add passkeys to their authentication without the need to dig deep into passkey / WebAuthn specifications.

## Passkey basics

In the following, we assume a basic understanding of passkeys and the underlying principles (e.g. WebAuthn). If you do not yet know about these principles and have questions like these:

* What are passkeys?
* Why are passkeys important?
* How do passkeys work?
* Are passkeys secure?

Then, please take a look at our [Passkeys FAQ](https://www.corbado.com/passkeys/faq) and [Passkeys Glossary](https://www.corbado.com/glossary) that should help you to understand the basics.

## Passkey concepts for developers

Passkeys introduce some new technical concepts and apply a different paradigm also for developers. To get your first passkey-based app to run as soon as possible, the following pages explain the most important passkey concepts for developers:

* [Relying party ID](/overview/passkeys/relying-party-id)
* [Passkeys in web apps](/overview/passkeys/passkeys-in-web-apps)
* [Passkeys in native apps](/overview/passkeys/passkeys-in-native-apps)
* [Fallback options](/overview/passkeys/fallback-options)
