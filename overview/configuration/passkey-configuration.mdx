## Introduction

These settings directly impact the passkey experience during sign-up and login and define what screens the user is going to see.

The following settings can be adapted in the [Developer Panel](https://app.corbado.com/app/settings/userinterface/passkeys) in the **Settings>Use interface>Passkeys** page:

1. [Cross-Device Authentication Strategy](/overview/configuration/passkey-configuration#1-cross-device-authentication-strategy): What strategy should be used for Cross-Device Authentication

## 1. Cross-Device Authentication Strategy

[Cross-Device Authentication (CDA)](https://www.corbado.com/glossary/cda) allows users to use a passkey from one device (CDA authenticator) for authentication on another device (CDA client), facilitating seamless access across diverse platforms.

While the two involved devices can come in a lot of different combinations, the most popular one is a desktop computer accessing a website and a smartphone holding the passkey, and processing the actual authentication.

Read our glossary entry and blog posts if you need more details and background information:

The Cross-Device Authentication strategy setting defines how Corbado's UI component behaves during sign-up and login:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Strategy</th>
<th>Sign-up</th>
<th>Login</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Minimize</td>
<td>CDA is not offered during sign-up</td>
<td>CDA cannot be used for login</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Standard (default)</td>
<td>CDA is not offered during sign-up</td>
<td>CDA can be used for login (e.g. using a passkey created directly on your smartphone)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Maximize</td>
<td>CDA is the only shown option (e.g. via QR code & hardware security key)</td>
<td>CDA can be used for login (e.g. using a passkey created directly on your smartphone)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<Note>
Since the CDA strategy is an advanced setting, we recommend leaving it at the default setting (**standard**). If you need help or have questions, please do not hesitate to [contact](https://www.corbado.com/contact) us.
