## Introduction

These settings directly impact the passkey experience during sign-up and login and define what screens the user is going to see.

The following settings can be adapted in the [Developer Panel](https://app.corbado.com/app/settings/userinterface/passkeys) in the **Settings>Use interface>Passkeys** page:

1. [Cross-Device Authentication strategy](/overview/configuration/passkey-configuration#1-cross-device-authentication-strategy): What strategy should be used for Cross-Device Authentication

## 1. Cross-Device Authentication strategy

Cross-Device Authentication (CDA) allows users to use a passkey from one device for authentication on another, facilitating seamless access across diverse platforms.

While the two involved devices can come in a lot of different combinations the most popular one is a desktop computer opening a website for example and a smartphone holding the passkey and processing the actual authentication.

Read our blog posts if you need more details and background information:

- [What is CDA (Cross-Device Authentication) in WebAuthn?](https://www.corbado.com/glossary/cda)
- [WebAuthn Passkey QR Codes & Bluetooth: Hybrid Transport](https://www.corbado.com/blog/webauthn-passkey-qr-code)

The strategy setting defines how Corbado behaves during sign-up and login:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Strategy</th>
<th>Sign-up</th>
<th>Login</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Minimize</td>
<td>CDA is not offered during sign-up</td>
<td>CDA can not be used for login</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Standard (default)</td>
<td>CDA is not offered during sign-up</td>
<td>CDA can be used for login (using a passkey created directly on your smartphone for example)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Maximize</td>
<td>CDA is the only option shown (QR code & security key)</td>
<td>CDA can be used for login (using a passkey created directly on your smartphone for example)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<Note>
Since the CDA strategy is an advanced setting we recommend leaving it at the default setting (**standard**). If you need help or have questions please do not hesitate to [contact](https://www.corbado.com/contact) us.
