## Introduction

Besides defining the [technical passkey settings in the previous section](/overview/configuration/passkey-configuration), we now take a look how the user flow and user experience can be adapted. These settings directly impact the user journey during sign-up and login.

The following settings can be adapted in the [Developer Panel](https://app.corbado.com/app/settings/userinterface) in the **Settings>Use interface** page:

1. [Sign-up settings](/overview/configuration/user-flow-configuration#1-sign-up-settings): Adjust the settings associated with the signup part of your user flow.
2. [Passkey pop-up frequency](/overview/configuration/user-flow-configuration#2-passkey-pop-up-frequency): Set the frequency for prompting users without a passkey to add one.
3. [Login identifiers and fallbacks](/overview/configuration/user-flow-configuration#3-login-identifiers-and-fallbacks): Configure your authentication path by specifying how users are authenticated.


## 1. Sign up settings
This sectin allow you to adjust the settings that affect the signup part of user authentication. <br/>You can configure two settings:
* Allow users to self-sign-up for your project.
* Require users to set their name.

## 2. Passkey pop-up frequency

If a passkey is not created during the registration process, the user can be offered the option to append a passkey during login using a fallback method. 
This setting allows adjusting the frequency at which a user without a passkey is prompted to append one. The options range from every login to once every 3 months.

## 3. Login identifiers and fallbacks

Corbado's UI-Components support multiple login identifiers.

<Tip>
  **Login identifiers** are unique and thus two user's can never use the same login identifier. 
  Login identifiers can be used for two different things: They can identify a user's account and they can act as a fallback when passkeys are not available.
</Tip>

Currently the following login identifier are supported:

- Email address
- Phone number
- Username 

![Login identifier](/images/overview/signup/user-flow-configuration/login-identifier.webp)

There are two types of login identifier:

- Verifiable by [one-time passcode](/overview/configuration/user-flow-configuration#3-4-1-one-time-passcode) or [email magic link](/overview/configuration/user-flow-configuration#3-4-2-magic-link) (email address and phone number)
- Not verifiable (username)"

Depending on the desired authentication journey, one or more login identifiers can be activated. Each activated login identifier is requested during the signup process. 

An overview of the available login identifiers and their properties can be found below. 


<table><thead><tr><th width="150">Login Identifier</th><th>[Allow Login](/overview/configuration/user-flow-configuration#3-1-allow-login)</th><th>[Fallback](/overview/configuration/user-flow-configuration#3-2-fallback)</th><th>[Verification stage](/overview/configuration/user-flow-configuration#3-3-verification-stage)</th><th>[Verification methods](/overview/configuration/user-flow-configuration#3-4-verification-methods)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Email address</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>none<br/>At sign-up<br/>Before first login</td><td>One-time passcode<br/>Email magic link</td></tr><tr><td>Phone number</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>None<br/>At sign-up<br/>Before first login</td><td>One-time passcode</td></tr><tr><td>Username</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>None</td><td>None</td></tr></tbody></table>

*These properties will be explained in detail in the next sections.*

### 3.1 Allow login
For each activated login identifier, an additional setting can be adjusted to determine whether it's allowed for login. If this setting isn't enabled, the activated login identifier serves after successful signup only as a fallback option.

### 3.2 Fallback

To ensure a smooth signup and login process, even when no passkeys are supported or available, a fallback option is always offered whenever possible.

If a verifiable identifier is activated, it automatically serves as the fallback option.

<Note> 
Enabling **only the username** will provide no fallback option and may leave users unable to recover accounts or authenticate on devices that do not support passkeys. To address this, it's recommended to activate a secondary identifier, without allowing login, to serve as a fallback.

</Note>

Find more information in the [Fallback Options](/helpful-guides/passkeys/fallback-options) page.


### 3.3 Verification stage

Define the stage at which your users need to verify their login identifier (e.g. email address, phone number or username). You can select only one option at a time.

<table><thead><tr><th width="227">Setting</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>None</td><td>Users do not have to verify their user identifier. They just sign up by creating a passkey and can immediately log in.</td></tr><tr><td>Verification before first login (default)</td><td>Users that sign up with a passkey are logged in after sign-up. They need to verify their user identifier on their first login though.</td></tr><tr><td>Verification at sign-up</td><td>Users can only create a passkey after verifying their user identifier first. </td></tr></tbody></table>

### 3.4 Verification methods

Corbado supports the following two types of verification methods.

- **One-time passcode**

  The one-time passcode (OTP) method entails sending a unique, time-sensitive 6-digit code to the user's registered email address or phone number. Once received, the user manually inputs this code into the login interface. Upon successful verification, the user gains access to the desired service or platform.
  <Note>
    In case you use Phone number as a login identifier:

    Corbado offers 10 SMS per account for testing purpose in the development environment. 
    To upper the limit or to integrate SMS verification in a production project,
    please [contact us](https://www.corbado.com/contact).
  </Note>

- **Email magic link**

  This method involves sending a unique, time-sensitive link to the user's registered email address. Upon clicking the link, the user is directed to a secure webpage where their identity is confirmed, granting access to the desired service or platform. 

  Currently, this method is only supported for email address.
