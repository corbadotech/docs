## Overview
Integrate Google's social connection with your app using Corbado by configuring the **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and **Authorized Redirect URI** in your Corbado project's settings.

For a streamlined development experience, Corbado provides preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances, which require no further setup.

However, for production environments, it is necessary to establish your own Google developer account and generate unique OAuth credentials.


## Preliminary Steps
- Create a Corbado project via the [Corbado developer panel](https://app.corbado.com/signin#register). More details are available in [Getting Started](/overview/getting-started).
- Create a Google Developer account by visiting the [Google Cloud console](https://console.developers.google.com/).

## Configuration Steps for Google Social Connection
1. In the [Corbado developer panel](https://app.corbado.com/signin#register), navigate to **Settings > User Interface > Social**. Activate the Google option and ensure "Use custom credentials" is selected. Copy the Authorized Redirect URI for later use.

## Recap
By following this guide, you should have:
- Created an OAuth client ID in Google Cloud Platform.
- Entered the authorized redirect URI as provided by the Corbado developer panel into the OAuth client ID.
- Configured the proper Client ID and Client Secret in the Corbado developer panel based on the values obtained from Google Cloud Platform.

After configuring, click "Save" to apply your settings. Congratulations, the Google Social Connection is now active for your instance.

## Transitioning to Production
Be aware that Google OAuth apps start in "Testing" status, which is suitable for internal testing and limits to 100 test users. Before transitioning to production, adjust the publishing status to "In Production" on the OAuth consent screen in the Google Cloud Platform console. This change necessitates a verification process concerning your application's name, logo, and requested scopes.
