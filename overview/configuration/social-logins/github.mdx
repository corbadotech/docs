# Integrating GitHub Social Connection with Corbado

## Overview
Integrate GitHub social connections into your application using Corbado by setting up the Client ID, Client Secret, and Authorized Redirect URI in your instance settings.

Corbado simplifies the development process by providing pre-configured OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development environments, meaning no additional configuration is necessary.

For production environments, you'll need to create your own Client ID and Client Secret through your GitHub account.

This guide will assist you in creating a GitHub account and setting up a GitHub OAuth app. For detailed steps on integrating OAuth using Corbado, please refer to the Social Connection (OAuth) guide.

## Prerequisites
- **Create a Corbado Application**: Access your Corbado developer panel to create an application. More details are available in the [Set up your application](#) guide.
- **GitHub Account**: You must have a GitHub account. [Create one here](#).

## Configuring GitHub Social Connection
### Registering a GitHub OAuth App
1. Navigate to **User & Authentication > Social Connections** in the Corbado developer panel and enable GitHub.
2. In the opened modal, ensure **Use Custom Credentials** is selected and copy the Authorized Redirect URI.
3. Visit the GitHub panel, enter the copied URI into the Authorization Callback URL field, and complete the app registration.

### Obtaining the Client ID and Client Secret
After registering:
1. You'll be redirected to the project's admin panel on GitHub.
2. Click **Generate a New Client Secret**.
3. Copy the provided Client ID and Client Secret.
4. Return to the Corbado developer panel and input these credentials in the designated fields.

Remember to click **Apply** in the Corbado developer panel to finalize the setup.

Congratulations, your instance is now configured for social connections with GitHub!
