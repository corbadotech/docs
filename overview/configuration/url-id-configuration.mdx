## Introduction

To get passkeys smoothly implemented, you need to adapt the following settings in the Corbado developer panel (not in your code):

* [Relying party ID](#relying-party-id)
* [Native app settings ](#native-app-settings)(only if you're using native apps)
* [Authorized origins](#authorized-origins) (for production deployments)
* [CNAME](#cname) (for production deployments)



For each of these settings, we provide recommendations and examples in the [URL Overview](/helpful-guides/url-overview) site.

## Relying party ID

The relying party ID is a crucial setting when working with passkeys and ensures that the passkey can only be used on the intended domain.

Please see also our [Relying Party ID page](/helpful-guides/passkeys/relying-party-id) to get more details or find recommendations and examples in the [URL Overview page](/helpful-guides/url-overview#7-relying-party-id).

The relying party ID an be defined [Settings > General > Urls](https://app.corbado.com/app/settings/general/urls).

## Authorized origins

The full URL (incl. protocol & port, no path) that the user sees in the browser and from where JavaScript calls to Corbado are made.

Please see also our [URL overview for authorized origins](/helpful-guides/url-overview#1-authorized-origin) to get more details, examples and recommendations.

## CNAME

THE CNAME DNS address (no protocol, port or path) that can be used instead of Corbado's default Frontend API URL. The CNAME needs to point to "\<Project-ID>.frontendapi.corbado.io".

Please see also our [URL overview for CNAME](/helpful-guides/url-overview#5-cname) to get more details, examples and recommendations.

The CNAME can be defined here [Setting > General > Go live](https://app.corbado.com/pro-7564790029695092989/app/settings/general/go-live)
