## Why should you use Corbado to offer passkey logins?

Corbado helps you to add passkeys to your sign-up and to your login. This involves taking care of all the passkey operations itself and fallback methods for cases when passkeys can not be used.&#x20;

As all of this involves a lot of complex UI, Corbado provides you with [prebuilt and configurable components](/frontend-integration/ui-components/).&#x20;

Moreover, Corbado offers device management, session management, recovery methods and keeps track of all the updates in the highly evolving landscape of passkeys (browser, operating systesm, specifications).

## How can you set up Corbado passkeys?

The following two configurations can be made that help you to implement passkeys smoothly

- [Passkey configuration](/overview/sign-up-and-login-with-passkeys/passkey-configuration): this will impact which apps and websites your users' passkeys can be used.
- [User flow configuration](/overview/sign-up-and-login-with-passkeys/user-flow-configuration): this will impact the user authentication journey (which screens is the user going to see).
