## User experience ‚ú®

![Passkeys flow from a user point of view](/images/User_Flow_Passkeys.png)

With Corbado, your users will login with passkeys using biometrics whenever possible. Apple users will be prompted to use _Touch ID_ or _Face ID_, Windows users will be prompted to use _Windows Hello_, etc.&#x20;

<Accordion title="Passkeys and user experience">
Passkeys are the most secure and convenient passwordless authentication. They offer a drastically better user experience than passwords, as they cannot be forgotten or mistyped. Passkeys are supported by Apple, Google and Microsoft, are synced within the respective cloud accounts and [can be shared via AirDrop](https://www.corbado.com/blog/share-passkeys-apple-devices).
For devices that don't support passkeys, Corbado automatically falls back to email magic links, OTPs or your existing password solution.
Corbado offers to enroll biometrics for any passkey-ready device. This allows Corbado to keep track of all trusted devices and intelligently provides the smoothest login experience possible.

## Security üîí

In addition to an improved user experience, passkeys better protect your users with [strong two-factor authentication in a single step](https://www.corbado.com/blog/passkeys-vs-2fa-security). When a user touches their fingerprint reader or completes facial recognition, they are simultaneously asserting _something they are_ and _something they have_. Biometric data never leaves the user's device, and Corbado relies on a combination of hardware-level security and public key cryptography to keep users safe. Read more about security [here](other/security-and-privacy.md).
