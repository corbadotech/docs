## 1. Introduction

Corbado provides comprehensive security logging capabilities designed to meet your organization's security requirements. Our security logging system captures and securely stores all critical events across the authentication infrastructure, providing complete visibility into user activities, administrative actions, and system operations.

<Note>
    For compliance-related events, refer to our dedicated page explaining our [audit log](/corbado-connect/security-compliance/audit-log).
</Note>

Key features of Corbado's security logging include:

- **Standardized Format**: Corbado's security logging is based on [OCSF](https://ocsf.io) (Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework), a widely adopted, vendor-agnostic global standard for cybersecurity event logging and reporting
- **Complete Event Coverage**: Security logs are automatically generated for all relevant event types, including authentication events, user management operations, and administrative changes
- **Tamper-Proof Storage**: All security logs are stored using Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) technology, ensuring data integrity and preventing unauthorized modifications
- **Long-Term Retention**: Security logs are retained for up to 10 years, depending on your requirements
- **Real-Time Streaming**: Stream security log events to external systems like SIEM platforms for real-time monitoring and analysis

This security logging system provides the foundation for maintaining security oversight and supporting forensic investigations when needed.

<Note>
    **Corbado Connect** implements version **1.6.0** of the **OCSF** schema specification.

## 2. Event Types

Corbado captures security log events from different operational areas to provide comprehensive visibility into the authentication infrastructure.

The security log covers the following event types (called classes in **OCSF**):

- **Account Change (3001)**: TODO description ([details](https://schema.ocsf.io/1.6.0/classes/account_change))
- **Authentication (3002)**: TODO description ([details](https://schema.ocsf.io/1.6.0/classes/authentication))
- **Entity Management (3004)**: TODO description ([details](https://schema.ocsf.io/1.6.0/classes/entity_management))
- **User Access Management (3005)**: TODO description ([details](https://schema.ocsf.io/1.6.0/classes/user_access))
- **Group Management (3006)**: TODO description ([details](https://schema.ocsf.io/1.6.0/classes/group_management))
- **API Activity (6003)**: TODO description ([details](https://schema.ocsf.io/1.6.0/classes/api_activity))

Each event includes detailed metadata such as timestamps, user identifiers, and contextual information for full traceability.

<Note>
    **Authentication events** are logged for all user interactions across your entire authentication infrastructure. This includes both end-users of your application using **Corbado Connect** and administrative users accessing the Corbado Management Console. All authentication attempts, whether successful or failed, are captured with full context to ensure complete audit coverage and support security investigations.
</Note>

## 3. Streaming

All security log events can be streamed in real-time to external systems for monitoring, analysis, and compliance purposes. Our streaming implementation includes robust retry logic to ensure reliable delivery of audit events.

This capability is particularly useful for feeding security log events into your **SIEM** (Security Information and Event Management) system for centralized security monitoring and alerting.

### 3.1. Supported Destinations

Corbado supports streaming to the following systems:

- **Amazon EventBridge**
- **Coralogix**
- **Datadog**
- **Dynatrace**
- **Elastic**
- **Honeycomb**
- **LogicMonitor**
- **New Relic**
- **Snowflake**
- **Splunk**
- **Sumo Logic**

Additionally, you can stream events to a **HTTP endpoint**, providing maximum flexibility to connect security logs to any system of your choice.
