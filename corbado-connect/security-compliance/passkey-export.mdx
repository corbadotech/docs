### 3.3 Reference Implementation: Migration Pattern

To demonstrate the practical application of our data portability solution, we provide a reference implementation for importing exported passkey credentials into the industry-standard [SimpleWebAuthn library](https://simplewebauthn.dev/). This implementation illustrates the straightforward nature of credential migration, enabling organizations to rapidly prototype and validate their authentication migration strategies. The following code can be directly integrated into the official SimpleWebAuthn [example repository](https://github.com/MasterKale/SimpleWebAuthn/blob/master/example/index.ts) to establish a functional migration pathway.

```javascript
function loadCredentialsFromCSV(): void {
  try {
    const csvPath = path.join(__dirname, '2025-09-15.csv');
    const csvContent = fs.readFileSync(csvPath, 'utf-8');

    const records = parse(csvContent, {
      columns: true,
      skip_empty_lines: true,
    }) as CSVRecord[];

    for (const record of records) {
      if (record.status === 'active') {
        // Parse base64url encoded fields
        const credentialId = Buffer.from(record.credentialId, 'base64url');
        const publicKey = Buffer.from(record.publicKey, 'base64url');

        // Parse transports
        const transports = record.transports.split(';').map((t: string) => t.trim()) as AuthenticatorTransport[];

        const credential: WebAuthnCredential = {
          id: credentialId.toString('base64url'),
          publicKey: publicKey,
          counter: parseInt(record.authenticatorSignCount, 10),
          transports: transports,
        };

        // Add credential to the default user
        const user = inMemoryUserDB[loggedInUserId];
        if (user) {
          // Check if credential already exists by comparing credential IDs
          const existingCred = user.credentials.find(cred =>
            cred.id === credential.id
          );

          if (!existingCred) {
            user.credentials.push(credential);
            console.log(`Loaded credential from CSV: ${record.credentialId}`);
          }
        }
      }
    }

    console.log(`Loaded ${inMemoryUserDB[loggedInUserId].credentials.length} credentials from CSV`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('Could not load credentials from CSV:', error);
  }
}
```

This reference implementation demonstrates key migration capabilities:

- **Credential Filtering**: Processes only active credentials to maintain authentication system integrity
- **Cryptographic Material Handling**: Properly decodes Base64URL-encoded credential IDs and public keys per WebAuthn specifications
- **Transport Protocol Parsing**: Maintains multi-factor authentication compatibility through transport method preservation
- **Idempotent Import Logic**: Implements duplicate detection to ensure safe re-execution during migration testing
- **Operational Visibility**: Provides console output for migration validation and troubleshooting

## 4. Checksum Verification and Data Integrity

### 4.1 Enterprise-Grade Data Integrity Controls

Corbado's Enterprise Passkey Export implements rigorous data integrity controls to ensure the authenticity and completeness of exported authentication data. Each export file is cryptographically verified using industry-standard checksum algorithms, providing your organization with independently verifiable proof that exported data remains unaltered during transmission and storage.

The checksum verification system addresses critical requirements for regulated industries:

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Satisfies data integrity requirements for financial services, healthcare, and government sectors
- **Audit Trail Validation**: Provides cryptographic proof of data integrity for compliance auditors and security teams
- **Tamper Detection**: Enables immediate identification of any unauthorized modifications to exported authentication data
- **Chain of Custody**: Establishes verifiable chain of custody for authentication data from export to import

### 4.2 CRC64NVME Checksum Implementation

To ensure performance at enterprise scale while maintaining cryptographic integrity, Corbado implements the `CRC64NVME` checksum algorithm for all passkey exports. This algorithm is specifically designed for high-performance verification of large datasets, making it ideal for organizations with substantial user bases requiring millions of passkey credentials.

### 4.3 Verification Procedure and Implementation

For organizations requiring independent verification of export integrity, Corbado provides a reference implementation written in Python using the AWS CRT library. This implementation enables your security and compliance teams to validate the integrity of exported files without relying on Corbado's internal verification systems.

```python
"""
Compute CRC64NVME checksum of a file using AWS CRT library.

This uses the official AWS CRT implementation for CRC64NVME checksums,
which matches the S3 `x-amz-checksum-crc64-nvme`/`ChecksumCRC64NVME` value.
"""

from awscrt import checksums
import base64
import sys
import os

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: python3 crc64nvme.py <file>", file=sys.stderr)
        return 1

    filepath = sys.argv[1]
    if not os.path.isfile(filepath):
        print(f"Error: '{filepath}' is not a file", file=sys.stderr)
        return 1

    with open(filepath, 'rb') as f:
        file_data = f.read()

    checksum = checksums.crc64nvme(file_data)
    checksum_bytes = checksum.to_bytes(8, byteorder='big')
    checksum_base64 = base64.b64encode(checksum_bytes).decode('ascii')

    print(checksum_base64)

    return 0

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sys.exit(main())
```

To verify the checksum of an export file, run the following commands:

```bash
# Create isolated Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv checksum-verification
source checksum-verification/bin/activate

# Install AWS CRT library for official CRC64NVME implementation
pip3 install awscrt

# Verify export file integrity
python3 crc64nvme.py /path/to/export/file.csv.gz
=> 5yuiJSxKKnU=
```

The generated Base64-encoded checksum can be compared with the value displayed in the Corbado Management Console to confirm data integrity. For automated verification workflows, this process can be integrated into your organization's CI/CD pipelines or security automation frameworks.
