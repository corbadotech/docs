**Gradual Passkey Rollout** enables controlled, risk-free passkey deployment by starting with small user groups and expanding gradually based on success metrics.

## Rollout Strategy

### Deployment Phases
1. **Internal Pilot**: Employees, developers, and testers only
2. **Customer Beta**: Small subset of actual users
3. **Gradual Expansion**: Progressively larger user groups
4. **Full Deployment**: All users have access

<Info>
Control passkey creation (append) rather than login. Users who create passkeys can always use them to log in, giving you precise control over adoption rates.
</Info>

## Segmentation Options

### Web Applications
- **Geographic Regions**: Deploy by country or region
- **IP Addresses**: Target specific network ranges
- **Browser Versions**: Test on specific browsers first
- **Operating Systems**: Control by OS version

### Native Applications
- **Device Models**: Target specific devices (e.g., iPhone 15)
- **Manufacturers**: Enable for Apple, Samsung, etc.
- **OS Versions**: Control by iOS/Android version
- **App Versions**: Gradual rollout with app updates

### User-Based Rules
- **User Subsets**: Custom user segments
- **Whitelist/Blacklist**: Individual user overrides
- **Invitation Tokens**: URL-based access control

<Warning>
Pay special attention to Android devices from certain manufacturers (particularly from China) which may have non-standard implementations. Test these thoroughly before broad rollout.
</Warning>

## Rule Configuration

Configure separate rules for different UI components:
- **Login Component**: Control passkey login availability
- **Append Component**: Control passkey creation opportunities  
- **List Component**: Control passkey management features


## Traffic Simulation

Before activating rules, simulate their effect:
- **7-Day Traffic Analysis**: Uses past week's data
- **Rule Impact Preview**: See how many users would be affected
- **Risk Assessment**: Understand potential issues before deployment


<Tip>
Always run simulations before activating new rules. This helps prevent unexpected impacts on user experience.
</Tip>

## Benefits

### Risk Reduction
- **Avoid Big Bang**: No risky all-at-once deployments
- **Early Issue Detection**: Find problems with small user groups
- **Quick Fixes**: Address issues before they affect many users
- **Controlled Exposure**: Limit impact of unexpected problems

### Data-Driven Approach
- **Real Metrics**: Make decisions based on actual data
- **A/B Testing**: Compare different approaches
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitor success at each phase
- **User Feedback**: Gather insights from early adopters

<Note>
The gradual rollout feature is essential for enterprise deployments. It transforms a potentially risky migration into a controlled, measurable process with clear success indicators.
