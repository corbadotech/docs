**Passkey Intelligence** is the core decision and prediction engine that optimizes passkey adoption through customizable, data-driven rules tailored to your specific use case.

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Hardware Security Key Control
**Configure whether users can use hardware security keys (YubiKeys)**
- Some applications may want to disable external authenticators
- Control security key usage per user segment
- Balance security needs with user convenience

### 2. Third-Party Password Manager Behavior
**Define how the system handles password managers like Bitwarden**

**Scenario**: User has Bitwarden passkey on Machine 1, accesses from Machine 2
- System assumes Bitwarden is synced across devices
- After 2 failed attempts, assumes Bitwarden not installed
- Stops offering passkey login on third attempt
- Provides fallback authentication instead

<Info>
This experimental behavior learns from user patterns to improve experience while maintaining high adoption rates.

### 3. Cross-Browser Passkey Handling
**Manage passkeys across different browsers on same device**

**Example**: Windows user with passkey in Chrome opens Firefox
- System attempts to use existing passkey twice
- After 2 failures, assumes different machine (not same Windows device)
- Offers fallback login for convenient access
- User can create new passkey after authentication

### 4. Cross-Device Authentication
**Control QR code and Bluetooth proximity features**
- Enable/disable cross-device authentication
- Manage QR code scanning options
- Control Bluetooth proximity requirements
- Balance security with user convenience

### 5. Credential Manager Restrictions
**Limit which credential managers can create passkeys**

**Regulated Industry Example**:
- Allow only: Apple iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager, Windows Hello
- Block all third-party password managers
- User can still create local passkey (private key stored)
- Backend prevents completion, blocking future login use

<Warning>
This is critical for regulated industries with strict security requirements. Users may create passkeys client-side, but the system prevents their use if from unauthorized managers.
</Warning>

## Trade-offs and Optimization

### Balancing Act
Configure the balance between:
- **High Adoption**: Maximize passkey usage
- **User Experience**: Minimize friction and confusion
- **Security Requirements**: Meet compliance needs
- **Technical Constraints**: Handle device limitations

### Customization Benefits
- **Industry-Specific**: Tailor to regulatory requirements
- **User-Specific**: Different rules for different segments
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Evolve rules based on data
- **A/B Testing**: Compare different approaches

<Tip>
Work with a Corbado adoption engineer to fine-tune your Passkey Intelligence configuration based on your specific traffic patterns and user behavior.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

- **Start Conservative**: Begin with fewer restrictions
- **Monitor Impact**: Track adoption and success rates
- **Iterate Gradually**: Make incremental adjustments
- **Document Decisions**: Keep records of rule rationale
- **Regular Reviews**: Reassess rules as ecosystem evolves

<Note>
Passkey Intelligence is crucial for maximizing adoption while maintaining security and user experience standards. The system continuously learns and improves based on user behavior patterns.
