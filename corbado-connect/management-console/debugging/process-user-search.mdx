## Process Search (90% of Cases)

The primary debugging tool for investigating user-reported issues.

### Search Capabilities
- **User Identification**: Search by email address or user ID
- **Process Filtering**: Filter by process type, time range, OS, and browser
- **Pro Mode**: Advanced filtering options for detailed investigation

### Process Details View

Each process provides comprehensive debugging information:

#### User Information (Top Left)
- User ID
- All passkeys and credentials (active/deleted)
- Password managers detected

#### Technical Context (Top Right)
- Platform and user agent details
- Device capabilities (Bluetooth)
-  WebAuthn features: Conditional UI, hybrid support status

#### Event Timeline (Bottom)
Two lanes showing the authentication flow:
- **Sub-processes**: High-level authentication steps
- **Events**: Detailed technical data with 2-3 events per sub-process

<Warning>
The real debugging work happens in the event lane at the bottom. Look for errors, timeouts, and unexpected behaviors in the technical details.
</Warning>

### Common Issues to look for
- **Timeout Errors**: User didn't complete authentication in time
- **Duplicate Passkey Attempts**: User trying to create passkey on already-registered device
- **Client-Side Errors**: Browser or device-specific failures
- **Password Manager Conflicts**: Issues with third-party credential managers

## User Search (10% of Cases)

For complex multi-device scenarios and cross-device authentication issues.

### When to use User Search
- Investigating cross-device authentication problems
- Understanding multi-device user journeys
- Analyzing long-term user behavior patterns
- Debugging edge cases not visible in single processes

### User Search Features

#### Comprehensive User View
- All processes concatenated over months/years
- Complete device inventory and usage patterns
- Cross-platform authentication history

#### Device Analysis
Track user activity across all devices:
- **Device Inventory**: All devices user has accessed from
- **Passkey Distribution**: Which devices have passkeys
- **Usage Patterns**: Login and creation statistics per device
- **Browser Breakdown**: Activity across different browsers

<Tip>
Multi-device scenarios are common sources of confusion. Use User Search to understand which devices have passkeys and where users are experiencing issues.

## Key Insights from Debugging

### Client-Side Visibility
Corbado provides unique client-side telemetry that was previously a black box:
- Detailed passkey intelligence data
- Device capability information
- Password manager interactions
- WebAuthn API responses

### Proactive Issue Resolution
- Once you identify an issue, search for other affected users
- Check if specific OS versions or browsers are impacted
- Implement fixes before more users encounter the problem

<Info>
The debugging tools are particularly valuable for understanding edge cases with specific Android manufacturers or third-party password managers, which may only affect a small percentage of users but create significant friction.
