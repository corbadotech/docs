## Core Reporting Metrics

The reporting feature provides three essential metric categories to track your passkey implementation:

### Login Metrics
Track detailed authentication patterns and user behavior:

- **Passkey Login Success**: Users who successfully authenticate with passkeys
- **Fallback Usage - No Passkey**: Users using fallback methods because they haven't created a passkey
- **Fallback Usage - Passkey Unavailable**: Users with passkeys who fall back due to technical constraints
- **Manual Fallback Selection**: Users who actively choose fallback methods over available passkeys
- **Daily and Monthly Trends**: Track authentication patterns over time

### Append (Creation) Metrics
Monitor passkey creation and onboarding success:

- **Append Screen Views**: How many users see the passkey creation prompt
- **Skip Rates**: Users who skip passkey creation opportunities
- **Successful Creation**: Users who successfully create passkeys from append screens
- **Conversion Tracking**: Monitor the effectiveness of your passkey creation flows

### Activity Metrics
Understand overall system usage and engagement:

- **Daily Active Users**: Track unique users authenticating each day
- **Monthly Active Users**: Aggregate monthly user activity (2M+ in production environments)
- **Process and Event Tracking**: Detailed system activity recording
- **Usage Patterns**: Identify peak usage times and seasonal trends

<Tip>
Use these metrics to track adoption progress and identify areas for optimization. The data can be accessed via API for integration with your existing billing and reporting tools.
