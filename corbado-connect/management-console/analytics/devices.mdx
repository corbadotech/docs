## Login Activity Overview

### Usage Frequency Segments
Track users by login frequency over past 12 months:
- **1 login**: One-time users
- **2 logins**: Occasional users
- **3 logins**: Light users
- **4-10 logins**: Regular users
- **11-20 logins**: Frequent users
- **20+ logins**: Power users

<Info>
Month-over-month percentages show growth/decline trends compared to past 30 days.
</Info>

## Passkey Usage Segmentation

### User Categories
Each frequency segment is divided into four passkey adoption levels:

1. **Neither**: No passkey created or used
2. **Append-only**: Created passkey but never used it
3. **Minority**: Uses passkey for less than 50% of logins
4. **Majority**: Uses passkey for more than 50% of logins

### Key Insights
- **Power User Adoption**: Check if frequent users embrace passkeys
- **Activation Gaps**: Identify which segments need attention
- **Usage Patterns**: Understand adoption by user engagement level

<Tip>
Focus on converting power users (20+ logins) to the "Majority" category first - they'll become your passkey champions.
</Tip>

## Platform-Specific Metrics

For each platform (iOS, Android, Windows, macOS):
- **Login Volume**: Daily authentication counts
- **OS Version Distribution**: Which versions are in use
- **Browser Usage**: Browser preferences by platform
- **Passkey Readiness**: Percentage of capable devices


<Info>
Use biometric setup statistics to counter concerns about user readiness - typically 95%+ have Face ID or PIN configured.
