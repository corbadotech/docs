## Authenticator Distribution

### Total View
View pie charts showing authenticator market share:
- **Major Authenticators** (>5% share): iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager, Windows Hello
- **Third-Party Managers**: 1Password, Bitwarden, and other password managers
- **Detailed Breakdown**: Complete list of all authenticators in use

### Combined Analytics
Combine authenticator data with:
- **Operating System**: See how authenticators distribute across iOS, Android, Windows, macOS
- **Browser Usage**: Understand which browsers are used with each authenticator
- **Market Share Insights**: Identify dominant combinations (e.g., iCloud Keychain + Safari)

<Info>
The most interesting insights come from third-party password manager usage patterns. For example, 1Password usage may be highest on iOS, followed by macOS and Windows.
</Info>

## Sync Status Analysis

Track whether passkeys are synced or device-bound:
- **Synced Passkeys**: Most iOS and Android passkeys via platform authenticators
- **Device-Bound**: Windows Hello passkeys (as of late 2024)
- **Cross-Platform Sync**: Passkeys synced via third-party managers on Windows

<Tip>
Monitor the percentage of Windows users with synced passkeys - these are using third-party password managers like 1Password or Bitwarden.
</Tip>

## Transport Capabilities

Understanding passkey transport tags:
- **Hybrid**: Passkeys that support cross-device authentication via QR code
- **Internal**: Platform authenticator passkeys
- **USB/NFC**: External security key support

## Time Series Analysis

### Trend Monitoring
Track changes over time by switching to daily/monthly views:
- **Authenticator Shifts**: Monitor adoption of new authenticators
- **OS Update Impact**: See how iOS/Android updates affect passkey behavior
- **Implementation Changes**: Track impact of your rollout changes

### Example Patterns
Common patterns to watch for:
- **iOS Updates**: Sharp changes in transport tags after iOS releases
- **Gradual Adoption**: Slow increase in third-party manager usage
- **Platform Shifts**: Migration between authenticators over time

<Warning>
Sudden drops in hybrid/internal transport tags may indicate iOS updates or implementation issues that need investigation.
</Warning>

## Use Cases

### Planning and Decision Making
- **Exclusion Policies**: See impact before blocking third-party managers
- **Error Investigation**: Correlate error patterns with specific authenticators
- **Rollout Planning**: Understand user preferences for targeted rollouts
- **Support Preparation**: Anticipate support needs based on authenticator distribution

### Key Metrics to Track
- Third-party password manager adoption rates
- Sync vs. device-bound ratios by platform
- Authenticator diversity in your user base
- Platform-specific preferences
