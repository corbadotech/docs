## Append Rate Analysis

### Overall Metrics
The append rate shows the percentage of users who create a passkey when shown an append/create screen:
- **Platform Breakdown**: Separate rates for web and native apps
- **Relative Percentages**: Success rates by platform
- **Absolute Numbers**: Total volume of append opportunities

### Multi-Screen Journey
Users don't always create passkeys on first exposure:
- **Screen 1**: Initial append screen conversion
- **Screen 2-3**: Users who need multiple prompts
- **Screen 4**: Persistent converters (often double-digit percentages)
- **Screen 5+**: Late adopters still converting

<Tip>
Even on the 4th append screen, conversion rates often remain in double digits. Don't give up on users too quickly.
</Tip>

## User Activation Rate

Track overall passkey adoption:
- **Total User Base**: Percentage with at least one passkey
- **Platform Comparison**: Activation rates by platform
- **Growth Tracking**: Monitor adoption progress over time

<Info>
Higher activation rates directly correlate with more users able to use passkeys for login, improving overall security and UX.
</Info>

## Operating System Performance

### Platform-Specific Append Rates
Compare performance across operating systems:
- **iOS**: Often highest rates (60%+ on first screen)
- **Android**: Moderate rates, watch for manufacturer variations
- **Windows**: Naturally lower initial rates
- **macOS**: Performance varies by browser

### Issue Detection
Use OS breakdowns to:
- Spot platform-specific problems
- Identify OS version issues
- Detect implementation flaws
- Prioritize optimization efforts

<Warning>
Significant variations between OS append rates may indicate platform-specific bugs or UX issues requiring attention.
