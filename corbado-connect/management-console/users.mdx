## Primary Use Cases

### 1. User Blacklisting
**Prevent problematic users from using passkeys**
- Users experiencing persistent errors
- Users with incompatible devices
- Temporary exclusion during troubleshooting
- Prevent repeated failed attempts

### 2. Passkey Management
**Support users with passkey issues**
- Delete public keys when requested
- Remove corrupted passkeys
- Help users start fresh
- Resolve authentication problems



<Warning>
Blacklisting should be used carefully. Always investigate the root cause of issues before blacklisting users.
</Warning>


## Common Scenarios

### Corrupted Passkey
User reports authentication always fails:
1. Search for user
2. Identify problematic passkey
3. Delete the passkey
4. User creates new passkey

### Device Incompatibility
User's device doesn't support passkeys properly:
1. Blacklist user temporarily
2. Investigate device-specific issue
3. Implement fix if possible
4. Unblacklist when resolved

### Password Manager Conflicts
Third-party password manager causing issues:
1. Review user's passkey inventory
2. Delete passkeys from problematic manager
3. Guide user to use platform authenticator
4. Monitor for recurrence

<Info>
The user management feature is essential for providing quality support at scale, ensuring users have a smooth passkey experience even when edge cases occur.
