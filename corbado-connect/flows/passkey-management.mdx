The following flow chart shows a typical passkey management flow and how it can be enhanced with **Corbado Connect**. The basic flow involves users accessing a dedicated settings area after logging in, where they can view all their registered passkeys, add new ones, and remove those they no longer use.

**Corbado Connect** integrates into this passkey management process, leveraging powerful features to maximize adoption and ensure a smooth user experience:

- [Gradual Rollout](/corbado-connect/features/gradual-rollout) allows you to control which users have access to passkey management features, enabling a phased introduction. By defining rules based on attributes like IP address, OS, or a percentage of users, you can introduce passkey management at your own pace and gather feedback from a smaller audience first.
- [Passkey Intelligence](/corbado-connect/features/passkey-intelligence) is a smart decision-making engine that creates the most seamless experience possible. It analyzes the user's context, like device capabilities and available authenticators, to determine if passkey creation is possible from the settings page, ensuring a smooth journey.
