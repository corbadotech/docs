## 1. Introduction

**CorbadoConnectPasskeyList** provides a complete UI for authenticated users to manage their passkeys.

## 2. When to Use This Component

This component should be loaded within a **profile or account management section** of your application where a user is already authenticated.

## 3. Rendering Logic

The component's rendering is primarily controlled by the **Gradual Rollout** feature. If the `allow-passkey-list` ruleset you've configured determines that the current user should not have access to passkey management, the component will not render at all.

## 4. User Experience

If rendered, the component allows the user to perform three main actions:

1.  **List existing passkeys**: See all passkeys associated with their account, including helpful metadata like the device it was created on and when it was last used.
2.  **Delete existing passkeys**: Revoke passkeys they no longer need.
3.  **Append new passkeys**: Add a passkey from their current device.

## 5. Error Handling

The component is designed to show clear, helpful error messages to the user within a pop-up modal. Planned errors that the user might encounter include:

-   **Unsupported device**: If the user tries to append a passkey on a device or browser that does not support WebAuthn.
-   **Passkey already exists**: If the user tries to append a passkey on a device that already has one registered for their account.

## 6. Example

> **Important:** This component is designed for users who are already logged in. You must generate `connectTokens` (see [here](/corbado-connect/concepts/connect-token)) on your backend for listing, appending, and deleting passkeys to validate that the user session is legitimate.

```js
<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.cloud.corbado.io/connect/dist/web-js-latest.min.js"></script>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.cloud.corbado.io/connect/dist/web-js-latest.min.css" />

  <script type="module">
    const passkeyListElement = document.getElementById('passkey-list');

    // This function is responsible for getting a connect token from your backend.
    // Your server would make a secure, server-to-server call to Corbado's Backend API.
    const connectTokenProvider = async (type) => {
      // 'type' will be 'passkey-list', 'passkey-append', or 'passkey-delete'
      const response = await fetch('/your-backend/generate-corbado-connect-token', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({ type }), 
      });

      const { token } = await response.json();

      return token;
    };

    Corbado.mountCorbadoConnectPasskeyList(passkeyListElement, {
      projectId: "pro-XXX", // Your Corbado Project ID
      frontendApiUrlSuffix: "frontendapi.cloud.corbado.io", // Points to your chosen Corbado Frontend API environment

      // Asynchronously provides connect tokens for all actions (list, append, delete)
      connectTokenProvider: connectTokenProvider
    });
  </script>
</head>

<body>
  <!-- The passkey list UI will render into this div -->
  <div id="passkey-list"></div>
</body>
```

| `connectTokenProvider`   | A function that asynchronously returns a [connect token](/corbado-connect/concepts/connect-token). It receives a `type` argument (either `'passkey-list'`, `'passkey-append'`, or `'passkey-delete'`) to specify which kind of token is needed from your backend.                                                            | âœ…            | `(type: string) => Promise<string>`    |

## 8. Customization

You can customize the component's appearance to match your application's design in two ways:

### 8.1 Through CSS Theme Variables

The easiest way to change colors, fonts, and border-radius is by overriding our CSS theme variables. You can set these in a `:root` block in your stylesheet (see the Customization section of the [CorbadoConnectAppend](/corbado-connect/web-ui-components/corbadoconnectappend) component for a full list of variables).

### 8.2 Through CSS Classes

For more detailed changes, you can directly target the component's CSS classes. All classes are scoped under the `.cb-connect-container` to avoid conflicts.

#### 8.2.1 Shared CSS Classes

These classes are used across multiple **Corbado Connect** components.

| **Class Name** | **Usage** |

| `.cb-primary-button` | Used for primary buttons |
| `.cb-secondary-button` | Used for secondary buttons |
