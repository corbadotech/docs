To test passkeys on Android emulator, you need to configure a few settings:

1. Open Android Studio and launch the AVD Manager.

2. Select your emulator and ensure it's running API level 30 or higher.

3. Set up a Google account on the emulator (needed for passkeys).

4. Enable a PIN or password under `Settings → Security`.

5. Enable Fingerprint authentication in `Settings → Security → Fingerprint`.

<Note>
    To simulate fingerprint authentication, you can use this command in the terminal:
    ```bash
    adb emu finger touch <finger_id>
    ```
</Note>

<Warning>
    Make sure your emulator is running API level 30 or higher, as passkey support requires Android 11 or newer.
