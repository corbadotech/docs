## 1. Introduction

While **RPID** configuration for web applications is straightforward and based on the application's [origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin), native/mobile applications present unique challenges. Unlike web browsers, native/mobile applications don't operate within the traditional concept of web [origins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin) and domains. This fundamental difference requires a special approach to establish trust between your domain and your native/mobile applications.

To enable passkey functionality in native environments, you need to create a secure association between your application and your domain. This is achieved through platform-specific association files:

- For **iOS** applications, this involves configuring an **Apple App Site Association (ASA)** file
- For **Android** applications, you'll need to set up an **Asset Links** file

These association files serve as digital proof that your native/mobile application is authorized to use passkeys associated with your domain's **RPID**. This security measure ensures that only legitimate applications can access and manage passkeys, preventing potential security vulnerabilities.
