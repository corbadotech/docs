## 1. Introduction

- Explain native/mobile applications are more tricky because the concept of an origin/browser url is not available
- To introduce a similiar concept we need to establish trust between a domain and a native/mobile application (ASA file and assetlinks.json)
- This differs per platform and will be explained in the following sections

## 2. iOS

## 3. Android

## 4. Local Development

- Explain that for native/mobile applications it is not as easy as for web applications
- Explain that you need ful ASA file and assetlinks.json file working for local development
- Explain shortcut if you only develop the native/mobile application and do not need to work it with a potential web application it is easiest to configure the Corbado Frontend API url as RPID (e.g. https://pro-1.frontendapi.corbado.io) and let Corbado deliver the ASA File and assertlinks.json for you.
