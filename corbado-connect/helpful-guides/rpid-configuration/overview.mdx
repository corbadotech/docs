The **RPID** (Relying Party Identifier) is a crucial security parameter in passkey authentication that defines which domains and applications can access your passkeys. Similar to how a cookie domain determines where a cookie can be used (read and written), the **RPID** determines where your passkeys can be used. 

Proper **RPID** configuration is essential for ensuring seamless passkey functionality across your web and native/mobile applications. For additional information, please refer to the official [WebAuthn specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#rp-id).

You can configure the **RPID** in the [Corbado Management Console](https://app.corbado.com/settings/general?tab=URLs). Review the following pages to understand how **RPID** validation functions and what key considerations apply to your application type:
