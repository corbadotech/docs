The Relying Party Identifier (RPID) is a crucial security parameter in passkey authentication that defines which domains and applications can access your passkeys. Similar to how a cookie domain determines where a cookie can be used, the RPID determines where your passkeys can be used. Proper RPID configuration is essential for ensuring seamless passkey functionality across your web and native/mobile applications.

<Info>
The RPID must be a valid domain name (e.g., `example.com`) and a registrable suffix of the application's origin. For web applications, this means the RPID must match or be a parent domain of your application's domain.
