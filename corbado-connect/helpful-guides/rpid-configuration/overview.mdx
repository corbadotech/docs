The **RPID** (Relying Party Identifier) is a crucial security parameter in passkey authentication that defines which domains and applications can access your passkeys. Similar to how a cookie domain determines where a cookie can be used, the **RPID** determines where your passkeys can be used. 

Proper **RPID** configuration is essential for ensuring seamless passkey functionality across your web and native/mobile applications. For additional information, please refer to the official [WebAuthn specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#rp-id).

The **RPID** can be configured in the [Corbado developer panel](https://app.corbado.com/settings/general?tab=URLs). It is different for web and native/mobile applications:
