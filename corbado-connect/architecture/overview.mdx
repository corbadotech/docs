The architecture diagram below provides a simplified view of how an environment similar to yours might interact with the **Corbado Connect** environment. It introduces several Corbado system components and how they interact with different components of your system.

For a deeper understanding, we recommend starting with our sections on the [user sign-up](/corbado-connect/flows/user-sign-up) and [user login](/corbado-connect/flows/user-login) flows. Additionally, more detailed documentation, including sequence charts and endpoint information, is available in our integration guides, such as for [Amazon Cognito](/corbado-connect/integration/cognito).
