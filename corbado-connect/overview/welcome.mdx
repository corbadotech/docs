## Introduction

üß© Corbado Connect allows you to easily add passkeys to your existing app, without changing your UX or replacing your entire authentication system. Thus, it's perfect for adding passkeys with no risk and gradually transitioning your users to passkeys.

  üõ°Ô∏è Corbado Complete is a full, standalone passkey-first authentication solution that can be used if you don't have any authentication in your app yet or want to completely replace your existing authentication solution. All data is stored in the cloud.
