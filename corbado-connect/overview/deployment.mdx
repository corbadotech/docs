When deploying Corbado Connect solution, you have the flexibility to choose between two deployment options: a **dedicated AWS instance** or our **public cloud**. Each offers different benefits in terms of customization, security, and compliance, depending on your organization's requirements.

## Dedicated AWS Instance

For organizations that require additional control over their deployment environment, Corbado Connect can be deployed on a dedicated AWS instance. This option provides a range of customization possibilities and higher guarantees in terms of security, data sovereignty, and compliance.

- **Security and Compliance**: By using a dedicated instance, your organization can implement custom security policies tailored to your needs. This includes setting stricter access controls, encryption standards, and monitoring protocols.
- **Data Sovereignty**: You have full control over the location of your data. You can deploy in specific AWS regions to comply with local data residency regulations, whether that’s in the **EU**, **Australia**, or **other regions**. This is particularly beneficial for industries like healthcare, finance, or government where compliance with data privacy laws is critical.
- **Customization**: A dedicated environment allows for extensive customization, including network configuration, firewall rules, and integration with other security infrastructure within your organization.

If your organization has strict regulatory requirements or needs a more tailored setup, a dedicated AWS instance ensures that your deployment meets those criteria.

## Public Cloud (Shared Instance)

Alternatively, you can choose to deploy Corbado on our **public cloud instance**. This option is hosted on a shared AWS infrastructure that is used by other Corbado customers, offering a cost-effective and quick-to-deploy solution.

- **Quick Setup**: The public cloud option is ideal for businesses looking to get started quickly with minimal setup. It’s a fully managed solution, meaning Corbado takes care of maintenance, security updates, and scaling.
- **Cost Efficiency**: The shared instance provides a lower-cost entry point compared to a dedicated instance, making it a great option for companies that prioritize ease of deployment without the need for extensive customization.
- **Scalability**: Even though it’s shared, the public cloud infrastructure scales automatically to meet demand, ensuring a smooth experience for your users.
