# Corbado Deployment Options

When deploying the Corbado Connect solution, you have two primary hosting models to choose from—our **public cloud** or a **dedicated AWS instance**. Each model offers different levels of customization, security, and availability, depending on your organization's requirements. Within the dedicated AWS model, there are multiple high-availability configurations to handle different disaster scenarios.

## Public Cloud (Shared Instance)

For organizations aiming for simplicity and speed, Corbado offers a **public cloud instance** hosted on shared AWS infrastructure. This is a cost-effective, fully managed environment where Corbado handles all maintenance, security updates, and scaling.

- **Quick Setup**: Ideal for businesses that want a frictionless path to go live.  
- **Cost Efficiency**: Shared infrastructure lowers operational costs.  
- **Scalability**: Automatically adapts to user demand, ensuring smooth performance.  

If your focus is on rapid deployment without extensive customization or regulatory constraints, the public cloud instance is an excellent fit.



## Dedicated AWS Instance

For organizations requiring tighter controls or more advanced compliance measures, Corbado can be deployed on a dedicated AWS instance. This deployment model provides full control over data residency, customized security policies, and network configuration. Within a dedicated AWS setup, you can choose from three levels of high availability and disaster recovery:

### 1. Multi-AZ Single-Region (Standard)

- **Description**: Runs in multiple Availability Zones (AZ) within a single AWS region.  
- **Infrastructure**:
  - Application workload runs in 3 of 3 AZs.  
  - Database workload runs in 2 of 3 AZs (MySQL RDS Multi-AZ).  
- **Resiliency**:
  - Automatically handles the failure of a single AZ (with near-zero data loss).  
  - If two out of three AZs fail, service may degrade until AWS stabilizes in the remaining AZ.  
  - Complete regional failure requires manual failover or data restore (4–8 hours RTO, up to 24 hours RPO).

### 2. Multi-AZ + Cross-Region Replica

- **Description**: Extends Multi-AZ by adding near real-time data replication to a secondary AWS region.  
- **Infrastructure**:
  - Primary environment identical to Multi-AZ Single-Region.  
  - Replicated data in another AWS region (&lt; 1 minute RPO).  
- **Resiliency**:
  - If two AZs fail or the entire primary region is impacted, you have a current copy of data in another region.  
  - Failover is still manual, but downtime is shorter (1-4 hours RTO, &lt; 1 minute RPO).  

### 3. Geo Failover-Ready

- **Description**: Maintains a secondary region with both replicated data and a partially deployed (cold) application environment.  
- **Infrastructure**:
  - Near real-time data replication to secondary region (&lt; 1 minute RPO).  
  - Secondary environment can be activated quickly with minimal manual intervention (push button).  
- **Resiliency**:
  - Ideal for organizations that demand the highest availability.  
  - In the event of a complete regional outage, recovery can occur within 15-30 minutes (RTO), with &lt; 1 minute RPO.

## Fallback Mechanism for Passkeys

Corbado's system architecture ensures that any disruption to the passkey component automatically falls back to traditional login methods (e.g., existing login methods). This means:

- **Minimal Impact**: Only passkey functionality is affected if a component fails.  
- **Continuous Checkout**: Payment or other workflows continue without interruption.  
- **Seamless Recovery**: Once the passkey service is restored, users can go right back to biometric authentication.

## Comparing RTO & RPO Across Deployment Configurations

The following table provides a high-level comparison of Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) for different failure scenarios across the dedicated AWS configurations.

| **Failure Event**             | **Multi-AZ Single-Region**              | **Cross-Region Replica**             | **Geo Failover**                                   |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single AZ Failure**         | RTO: 1-5 min<br/>RPO: ~0 min                         | No need to fail over                             | No need to fail over                                     |
| **Two AZ Failure**            | RTO: 15-30 min<br/>RPO: ~0 min<br/><br/>*Until AWS stabilizes* | RTO: 1-4 h<br/>RPO: &lt; 1 min<br/><br/>*Manual failover if required* | RTO: 15-30 min<br/>RPO: &lt; 1 min<br/><br/>*Push-button failover* |
| **Primary Region Failure**    | RTO: 4-8 h<br/>RPO: up to 24 h<br/><br/>*Manual failover* | RTO: 1-4 h<br/>RPO: &lt; 1 min<br/><br/>*Manual failover*  | RTO: 15-30 min<br/>RPO: &lt; 1 min<br/><br/>*Push-button failover*    |

## Next Steps

1. **Evaluate Your Requirements**: Determine whether a shared or dedicated environment best meets your security, compliance, and performance needs.
2. **Choose a High-Availability Tier** (if you select the dedicated AWS option): Decide which resiliency model (Multi-AZ Single-Region, Multi-AZ + Cross-Region Replica, or Geo Failover-Ready) aligns with your risk tolerance and recovery objectives.
