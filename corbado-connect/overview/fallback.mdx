One of the key features of Corbado Connect is its **fault-tolerant** design, ensuring that your existing authentication flow remains unaffected, even in the event of an error or interruption.

Our system is built in a **riskless** way, meaning there is no storage of personally identifiable information (PII) on Corbado's side, and passkeys can be rolled out gradually without any risk of disrupting your current authentication system.

## Automatic Fallback to Existing Authentication Methods

Even if a passkey-related issue occurs—whether it’s due to a technical fault, service unavailability, or the user canceling the process—Corbado Connect detects the issue and **automatically falls back** to your existing authentication method. This means that:

- **No interruptions for users**: Users will seamlessly be directed back to the login method that is already in place, whether it’s passwords, SMS-based 2FA, or authenticator apps. In most cases, users won’t even notice that a fallback occurred.
- **Fault tolerance**: By design, Corbado integrates with your existing authentication mechanisms without introducing risks. It ensures that 2FA or MFA is always enforced, regardless of whether the passkey system is active or falls back to another method.
- **Gradual rollout**: You can roll out passkeys gradually, testing them with specific user segments or cohorts, knowing that the fallback system ensures a smooth transition without any risk of login failure for users.

## Seamless Experience for Developers and Users

Corbado Connect uses **JavaScript callbacks** to handle errors or cancellations in real-time. These callbacks enable the system to re-display the existing login page or another MFA option, allowing users to authenticate without disruption.

This level of **resilience** means you can deploy Corbado without any concerns about failure points or user experience degradation, making it a completely risk-free enhancement to your security architecture.
