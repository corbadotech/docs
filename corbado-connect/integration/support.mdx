At Corbado, we see ourselves as more than a vendor; we are your dedicated integration partner. We understand that integrating a critical component like passkey authentication into complex enterprise IT systems requires a close, collaborative effort. Our mission is to ensure your success, and we're committed to being there with you every step of the way.

## 1. Our Hands-On Integration Philosophy

**Corbado Connect** is designed for maximum flexibility to adapt to diverse authentication setups. We recognize that this can lead to complexity when integrating with existing IT infrastructures. That's why our support model is fundamentally different:

-   **We're Part of Your Team:** We don't just hand you documentation and wish you luck. We roll up our sleeves and work directly with your engineers and project managers.
-   **Dedicated Integration Budget:** Our enterprise contracts include a generous time and budget allocation for integration work, ensuring you have the expert resources you need without unexpected costs.
-   **Global On-Site Support:** We believe in the power of face-to-face collaboration. Our experts are available to travel worldwide and work on-site with your local IT teams to tackle challenges and ensure a seamless rollout.

Our job isn't done until your integration is successful and you are completely satisfied.
