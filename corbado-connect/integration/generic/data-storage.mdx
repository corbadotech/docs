## 1. Introduction

When it comes to storage, the integration between **Corbado Connect** and your authentication system is straightforward and requires **no changes** to your existing database infrastructure.

## 2. Architecture

**All passkey data is stored within Corbado Connect**, including:

- **Passkeys and WebAuthn credentials**: Securely stored with enterprise-grade encryption
- **User metadata**: Minimal identifiers needed to link your users with their passkeys
- **Authentication logs**: Audit trails for passkey operations and user activities

This approach tremendously simplifies integration and cuts down implementation time since no database schema changes are required on your end.

<Note>
**Corbado Connect** only stores the public key of the passkey. The private key is never stored and is never accessible to **Corbado Connect**.
</Note>

## 3. Portability

**Corbado Connect** ensures you maintain full control over your data:

- **Export capabilities**: Passkeys can be exported at any time, fully automated to any external system including yours
- **Standard compliance**: All data follows WebAuthn and FIDO2 standards for maximum portability
- **Migration support**: Complete data migration assistance available when needed

<Note>
See our documentation on [Passkey Export](/corbado-connect/security-compliance/passkey-export) for more details including field descriptions and an example import implementation for the JavaScript/TypeScript [SimpleWebAuthn](https://simplewebauthn.dev/) library.
</Note>

## 4. Security & Compliance

All storage meets the highest security standards:

- **ISO 27001 certified**: Information security management system compliance
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Rigorous security, availability, and confidentiality controls
- **Enterprise encryption**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Regular audits**: Continuous security assessments and penetration testing
- **No PII**: **Corbado Connect** does **not** durable store any personal information (PII) such as names, emails, or phone numbers.

## 5. System Integration

**Corbado Connect** stores your user ID to seamlessly connect both systems during:

- **Passkey Enrollment**: Links new passkeys to existing user accounts
- **Passkey Login**: Validates passkey ownership against the correct user
- **Passkey Management**: Ensures passkey operations are performed by authorized users

This minimal data synchronization maintains the integrity of both systems while preserving user privacy.
