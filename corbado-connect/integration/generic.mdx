## Introduction

**Corbado Connect** allows you to seamlessly integrate passkey-first authentication into your existing Identity Provider (IdP) or authentication system. This enables you to offer your users a secure and convenient login experience without passwords, while still leveraging your existing user management infrastructure.

This guide provides a generic approach to integrating **Corbado Connect** with any authentication system, whether it's:

- A custom-built authentication solution
- A third-party Identity Provider (IdP)
- An authentication framework or library

The integration patterns described here can be adapted to work with virtually any authentication system that allows for custom authentication flows or external identity verification.

While we provide specific integration guides for popular authentication providers like [Amazon Cognito](/corbado-connect/integration/cognito), this guide serves as a foundation for integrating with any other authentication system.

## User Sign-up

- transfer same section of cognito documentation @/corbado-connect/integrations/cognito.mdx to this generic case

### Implementation Overview

- transfer same section of cognito documentation @/corbado-connect/integrations/cognito.mdx to this generic case

### UI Component Integration

- transfer same section of cognito documentation @/corbado-connect/integrations/cognito.mdx to this generic case

### Obtaining the ConnectToken

- transfer same section of cognito documentation @/corbado-connect/integrations/cognito.mdx to this generic case

## User Login

- transfer same section of cognito documentation @/corbado-connect/integrations/cognito.mdx to this generic case

### Implementation Overview

- explain signedPasskeyData (JWT) that everything "concentrates" around this jwt when we need to hand-over authentication state between Corbado Connect and the external system
- there are multiple options which will be explained next

#### Option 1: IdP extension

- this option is implemented by extending the existing IdP (with configuration or writing a plugin for example)
- refer to cognito custom auth flow/lambda functions
- signedPasskeyData will be passed to the external IdP and will be handled there
- first signedPasskeyData must get verified by doing a call to Corbado Backend API /v2/passkeys/verifySignedPasskeyData
- if successfully a session is created and returned (or own tokens JWT, access token etc.)
- transfer mermaid chart from "User Login > Implementation Overview" @/corbado-connect/integrations/cognito.mdx to this generic case (use a "External IdP" participant)

#### Option 2: Own endpoint

- this option is implemented by implementing your own endpoint
- send signedPasskeyData to own endpoint
- verify signedPasskeyData by doing a call to Corbado Backend API /v2/passkeys/verifySignedPasskeyData
- if successfully a session is created and returned (or own tokens JWT, access token etc.)
- transfer mermaid chart from "User Login > Implementation Overview" @/corbado-connect/integrations/cognito.mdx to this generic case (use a "ExampleBackend" participant)

#### Option 3: Corbado Action

- this option is implemented by implementing the post-login Corbado Action
- here you can create your own session and return a session id and/or token to the finish call

### UI Component Integration

- explain UI component integration/source-code from @/corbado-connect/ui-components/corbadoconnectlogin.mdx
- leave out the oncomplete callback and explain that is it option-depended and will be explained next

#### Option 1: IdP extension

- just redirect to profile page

#### Option 2: Own endpoint

- make call to own endpoint (ExampleBackend)
- explain that this new endpoint makes a call to Corbado Backend API /v2/passkeys/verifySignedPasskeyData (see sequence-chart)
- if successfully a session is created (response contains session cookie for example)
- explain session cookie case and jwt in response that you then can set as cookie or local storage or keep in memory

#### Option 3: Corbado Action

- just redirect to profile page
