TODOS:
- extend flows with links to this generic guide
- mark option 3 somehow? "(planned)"? "(beta)"?

## Introduction

- write generic Introduction
- we have no example application
- explain that corbado connect can be integrated into any authentication system, either fully custom-build or using other IdPs/solutions
- mention that there is a specific integration guide for Cognito
- this one is kept generic so it can be applied to any usecase

## User Sign-up

- transfer same section of cognito documentation @/corbado-connect/integrations/cognito.mdx to this generic case

### Implementation Overview

- transfer same section of cognito documentation @/corbado-connect/integrations/cognito.mdx to this generic case

### UI Component Integration

- transfer same section of cognito documentation @/corbado-connect/integrations/cognito.mdx to this generic case

### Obtaining the ConnectToken

- transfer same section of cognito documentation @/corbado-connect/integrations/cognito.mdx to this generic case

## User Login

- transfer same section of cognito documentation @/corbado-connect/integrations/cognito.mdx to this generic case

### Implementation Overview

- explain signedPasskeyData (JWT) that everything "concentrates" around this jwt when we need to hand-over authentication state between Corbado Connect and the external system
- there are multiple options which will be explained next

#### Option 1: IdP extension

- this option is implemented by extending the existing IdP (with configuration or writing a plugin for example)
- refer to cognito custom auth flow/lambda functions
- signedPasskeyData will be passed to the external IdP and will be handled there
- first signedPasskeyData must get verified by doing a call to Corbado Backend API /v2/passkeys/verifySignedPasskeyData
- if successfully a session is created and returned (or own tokens JWT, access token etc.)
- transfer mermaid chart from "User Login > Implementation Overview" @/corbado-connect/integrations/cognito.mdx to this generic case (use a "External IdP" participant)

#### Option 2: Own endpoint

- this option is implemented by implementing your own endpoint
- send signedPasskeyData to own endpoint
- verify signedPasskeyData by doing a call to Corbado Backend API /v2/passkeys/verifySignedPasskeyData
- if successfully a session is created and returned (or own tokens JWT, access token etc.)
- transfer mermaid chart from "User Login > Implementation Overview" @/corbado-connect/integrations/cognito.mdx to this generic case (use a "ExampleBackend" participant)

#### Option 3: Corbado Action

- this option is implemented by implementing the post-login Corbado Action
- here you can create your own session and return a session id and/or token to the finish call

### UI Component Integration

- explain UI component integration/source-code from @/corbado-connect/ui-components/corbadoconnectlogin.mdx
- leave out the oncomplete callback and explain that is it option-depended and will be explained next

#### Option 1: IdP extension

- just redirect to profile page

#### Option 2: Own endpoint

- make call to own endpoint (ExampleBackend)
- explain that this new endpoint makes a call to Corbado Backend API /v2/passkeys/verifySignedPasskeyData (see sequence-chart)
- if successfully a session is created (response contains session cookie for example)
- explain session cookie case and jwt in response that you then can set as cookie or local storage or keep in memory

#### Option 3: Corbado Action

- just redirect to profile page
