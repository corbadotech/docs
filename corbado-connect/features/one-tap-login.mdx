## 1. What is One-Tap Login?

</Frame>

One-Tap Login is a feature from **Corbado Connect** that allows your users to sign in to your application with a single touch or click, plus a quick biometric verification like Face ID or a fingerprint scan. It completely eliminates the need for users to type their username or email address on subsequent visits, creating a truly seamless and secure login experience.

This is made possible by our dynamic **One-Tap Passkey Button**, which intelligently appears for returning users who have previously used a passkey on that device.

## 2. How It Works: The User's Journey

The magic of One-Tap Login lies in its simplicity. Here's a typical user journey:

<Steps>
<Step title="First Interaction: Creating a Passkey">
A user signs up or logs in for the first time. During this process, they are prompted to create a passkey, which securely links their account to their device. Our [Passkey Intelligence](/corbado-connect/features/passkey-intelligence) engine notes that this user now has a passkey on this device.
</Step>
<Step title="The Return: One-Tap Login Appears">
When the user returns to your app, our system recognizes them. Instead of a blank login form, they are greeted with a personalized button, like "Login with Passkey as **alice@example.com**".
</Step>
<Step title="Instant Access: The Tap">
The user simply taps the button, verifies their identity with their device's built-in biometrics (like Face ID or fingerprint), and they're in! No typing, no forgotten passwords, just instant access.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Visual UI Flow Examples**: See the [One-Tap Login UI flows](/passkey-ui-flows/web/passkey-login/one-tap) for platform-specific visual demonstrations of this journey across macOS, Windows, iOS, and Android.

## 3. Key Benefits of One-Tap Login

Implementing One-Tap Login offers significant advantages for both your users and your business.

-   **Drastically Improved User Experience:** By removing the friction of typing credentials, you make logging in effortless and fast, leading to happier users.
-   **Increased Conversion and Retention:** A smoother login process reduces drop-offs and encourages users to return more often.
-   **Enhanced Security:** One-Tap Login is built on the foundation of passkeys, which are phishing-resistant and far more secure than passwords.
-   **Boosted Passkey Adoption:** Highlighting the passkey option as the easiest path to login encourages more users to adopt this secure technology.

## 4. Smart Handling of Multiple Scenarios

Corbado's One-Tap Login is designed to be intelligent and handle various situations gracefully:

-   **Multiple Accounts:** If a user has more than one account, the One-Tap button will default to the last one used, with an easy option to switch.
-   **New Devices:** On a new device, the user will go through the standard login flow once. After their first passkey use on that device, One-Tap Login will be available for all future visits.
-   **Seamless Fallbacks:** One-Tap Login is powered by our [Passkey Intelligence](/corbado-connect/features/passkey-intelligence) engine, which ensures that if a passkey isn't available, the user is seamlessly guided to another authentication method without any confusion.
