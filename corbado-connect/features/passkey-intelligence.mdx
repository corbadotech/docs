## What is Passkey Intelligence?

Passkey Intelligence is a smart authentication logic layer provided by Corbado that optimizes when and how passkeys are used in your application. It ensures a smooth user experience by only initiating passkey login or creation ceremonies when success is likely, and by gracefully falling back when not. 

By leveraging a wealth of signals from the user's device, behavior, and environment, Passkey Intelligence dynamically adapts the authentication flow to each situation, boosting both security and user convenience. In short, Passkey Intelligence is the engine that makes high passkey adoption possible – providing one-tap logins, seamless cross-device sign-ins, and context-aware prompts that significantly improve the user experience.

At its core, Passkey Intelligence acts as a prediction and decision engine determining the optimal authentication path for each login or signup attempt. It continuously aggregates multiple data points to assess whether a passkey can or should be used on the current device. Key factors include:

-   **Device & Browser Capabilities:** The engine checks the operating system, browser version, and WebAuthn support of the client device. Hardware features like biometric sensors or Bluetooth availability are considered to know if passkeys (including cross-device options) are supported.
-   **User's Passkey History:** It analyzes if the user has previously created or used a passkey, and on which devices. Past successful passkey logins, as well as instances where the user fell back to passwords/OTP, are tracked to inform future decisions. For example, if the user has a registered multi-device ("hybrid") passkey synced to cloud or a password manager, that's noted for cross-device availability.
-   **Contextual Behavior:** The system monitors how users interact with passkey prompts (e.g. do they cancel them? how often do errors occur?). It also keeps an eye on how frequently users skip passkey offers or choose alternative methods, which helps tailor when to prompt them.
-   **Security & Risk Signals:** To safeguard against edge cases, Passkey Intelligence evaluates risk indicators like unusual login patterns, IP or location changes, and device integrity signals. If something looks suspicious or if the environment is not passkey-friendly, the engine may avoid a passkey prompt and opt for a safer fallback automatically.
-   **Local Device Storage Flags:** To make quicker decisions, a small flag is stored in the user's browser (e.g. via `localStorage`) after a successful passkey login. This tells the front-end that "this user *does* have a passkey on this device" for subsequent visits, allowing the UI to directly offer a one-tap passkey login without additional server checks.

Using this data, the intelligence engine dynamically chooses one of several paths for the user's session: it might automatically initiate a platform passkey authentication, present a **One-Tap Passkey** login button (prefilled with the user's identifier), fall back to a password/OTP flow, or even trigger a **cross-device login** via QR code if no local credentials are available. The goal is to always select the least friction path that still ensures a successful, secure login.

## Benefits and Use Cases

Implementing Passkey Intelligence yields significant benefits in both user experience and security outcomes:

-   **Seamless UX & Higher Success Rates:** Because the system only offers a passkey prompt when it's confident the user can complete it, users encounter far fewer errors and failed login attempts. By avoiding dead-end scenarios (like prompting passkeys on unsupported devices), you reduce user frustration and build trust in the new login method.
-   **Maximized Passkey Adoption:** Passkey Intelligence directly drives up the **passkey login rate**, which is the share of total logins done with passkeys instead of passwords or OTPs. High passkey usage correlates with fewer password resets and lower MFA costs (SMS/OTP), delivering both security and ROI benefits.
-   **Smooth Fallbacks & No Dead-Ends:** In scenarios where a passkey isn't available or likely to work (e.g. user on a work PC without their personal passkey), the system will seamlessly revert to the next-best method *before* the user even realizes a passkey attempt was possible. This means no confusing error messages or unnecessary QR code screens that could scare users off.
-   **Cross-Device Convenience:** Passkey Intelligence improves cross-device login flows by proactively leveraging **cloud-synced passkeys** and multi-device credentials. If a passkey must be used from another device (via a QR code scan), intelligence ensures the user is guided clearly and even helps them **attach a new local passkey** to that device afterward for the future. For example, if a user attempts to log in on their laptop but their only passkey is on their phone, the system can present a QR code. After authenticating on their phone, they are logged in on the laptop and immediately prompted to create a new, local passkey on the laptop, eliminating the need for a QR code on subsequent visits.
-   **Adaptive to User Behavior:** The intelligence engine isn't static; it learns from your user base. By analyzing patterns (e.g. many users aborting at a certain step or opting for "Skip" on passkey prompts), you can adjust your flows – or let Corbado adjust them automatically.
-   **Enterprise-Grade Security Controls:** Every login attempt is evaluated with security in mind. Suspicious signals (multiple rapid failures, new device in a far location, etc.) can trigger the engine to be more conservative – perhaps not auto-launching a passkey and requiring an extra verification step. This balances user-friendliness with risk mitigation.
-   **`clientState` Management:** After a successful passkey operation, Corbado returns a `clientState` string containing encrypted, environment-related information. This state is stored in the browser's `localStorage` to remember the user's context, such as device capabilities and passkey availability. By passing this `clientState` back into UI components in future sessions, you enable faster load times and more seamless flows, like One-Tap login, without repeating environment checks.

## Integration in Login and Signup Flows

Integrating Passkey Intelligence into your authentication flows can be done in a couple of patterns, depending on your UI/UX approach. Corbado supports both **Identifier-First (Automatic)** flows and **Explicit Passkey Button** flows.

### Identifier-First Login Flows
In this approach, the user first enters an identifier (like email or username) and then the system decides whether to trigger a passkey prompt automatically. Once the user submits their identifier, Corbado's engine evaluates if a passkey login should be initiated right away. If yes, the passkey WebAuthn ceremony is auto-launched. If no, the flow silently falls back to the next step (e.g., asking for a password or sending an OTP). This conditional logic means you "auto-login" with passkey when possible, but never at the cost of user confusion.

### Separate Passkey Button Flows
Many applications opt to show a "Login with Passkey" button as an alternative to the traditional login form. Passkey Intelligence augments this approach with the **One-Tap Passkey Button** component. Initially, you might display a normal "Use passkey" button. But once a user becomes eligible for a passkey, the component automatically switches to the One-Tap mode on subsequent visits. This means the next time that user comes back, they'll see a personalized passkey login prompt (e.g. "Login with passkey for **alice@example.com**") right up front.

### Signup / Registration Flows
Passkey Intelligence also enhances the account creation process to boost passkey enrollment. When a new user signs up or when an existing user logs in with a password, Corbado can intelligently prompt them to create a passkey. 

You can configure how this happens. For example, some services choose to automatically initiate passkey creation immediately after a standard login on a supported device. However, you might prefer to first show an explanation screen before creating the passkey. Corbado's components offer customizable passkey enrollment screens that you can enable or skip. You can even tailor these based on device type.

## Passkey Creation and Autofill

When using Passkey Intelligence, the flow of creating a passkey and subsequently using it is optimized end-to-end.

### Passkey Creation
If a user is on a passkey-capable device and authenticates via a non-passkey method (like a password), the intelligence engine can immediately guide them into creating a passkey. One option is **Automatic Passkey Creation**, where the passkey ceremony starts without the user explicitly clicking anything, often right after they log in for the first time.

If you prefer a more explicit opt-in, you can disable automatic creation and use **Passkey Explainer screens**. Corbado's UI components include an **Append Passkey Prompt** – a modal or page shown after sign-up/login that explains passkey benefits and asks the user to continue to set one up. Either way, once the user agrees, the WebAuthn `create()` call is executed and the new passkey is stored by the user's device (in their platform authenticator or manager).

### Autofill and One-Tap Behavior
After a passkey is created, using it in subsequent logins should be effortless. Modern browsers implement what's known as **Conditional UI**, which is essentially a built-in *autofill* for passkeys. If a site is set up correctly, the browser might show a "Use your passkey for *example.com*" prompt or account chooser automatically when the login form is displayed.

Passkey Intelligence works hand-in-hand with such browser features. However, where Conditional UI is not supported or ignored by the user, Corbado's **One-Tap Passkey Button** ensures a one-tap option is always visible in the UI itself for returning users. The intelligence engine effectively pre-fills the user's identifier into this button using data stored from their last passkey login. It's akin to the "Remember me" function but for passkeys – the user doesn't even have to type their email; the button itself shows the account that will sign in with a biometric check.

## One-Tap Login

One of the flagship features enabled by Passkey Intelligence is **One-Tap Login** – a mechanism that allows returning users to authenticate with a single tap (plus biometric) without needing to re-enter their identifier. This is implemented via the **One-Tap Passkey Button**, a dynamic UI element that Corbado injects into your login page when appropriate.

<Steps>
<Step title="Initial Passkey Use or Enrollment">
A user either logs in with a passkey or creates a new passkey for their account. At this moment, Passkey Intelligence records that this user (identifier) now has a passkey on the current device. It stores this information in the browser (`localStorage`) and in Corbado's backend.
</Step>
<Step title="Next Login – One-Tap Activates">
When the user returns to the login page, the Corbado front-end component detects the prior passkey usage and automatically renders a **One-Tap Passkey Login** button at the top of the login form. This button is labeled with the user's identifier, e.g. "Login with Passkey as **alice@example.com**". The user simply clicks that button, and immediately the passkey authentication is initiated – prompting for Face ID / Touch ID.
</Step>
<Step title="Handling Multiple Accounts or New Devices">
If the user has multiple accounts on the same device, the One-Tap button will default to the last used one, but Corbado also provides a way to switch accounts. On completely new devices, One-Tap won't show up initially. However, after the first passkey use on the new device, the feature spreads to it without hassle.
</Step>
</Steps>

One-Tap Login is particularly powerful for improving adoption in the "separate passkey button" scenario. While a separate button might be ignored, as soon as a user has used a passkey once, the login page transforms – the One-Tap passkey option becomes the highlighted default.
