## What is Passkey Intelligence?

Passkey Intelligence (PI) is Corbado's decision-making system that optimizes the user experience by making contextual choices about when and how to offer passkey functionality. It analyzes a user's environment, device capabilities, and past behavior to present the most seamless and effective authentication flow.

It's important to distinguish Passkey Intelligence from Gradual Rollout (GR):
- **Passkey Intelligence (PI)**: A sophisticated system that makes real-time, user-specific decisions to improve the passkey experience.
- **Gradual Rollout (GR)**: A simpler gating mechanism used to control feature availability to broader user groups, often during initial project rollout phases.

## How does it work?

At its core, Passkey Intelligence is a learning system that gathers context to make smart decisions.

1.  **It Gathers Context**: Before any passkey operation, PI collects data about the user's environment. This includes the device and browser, its known passkey capabilities, the user's existing passkeys, and any detected password managers.
2.  **It Makes a Decision**: Using this context, PI's rule-based engine decides the best course of action. For example, it might encourage using a device's built-in authenticator (like Face ID or Windows Hello) if it knows one is available, or it might prepare a cross-device flow if the user is on a new machine.
3.  **It Learns and Adapts**: PI records the outcomes of these interactions. This allows it to learn and improve future decisions. For example, it can learn which browsers on a user's laptop share the same passkeys, ensuring a more consistent experience across them.

## Key Scenarios

Passkey Intelligence is primarily applied in two scenarios to enhance the user journey:

-   **Passkey Login**: When a user initiates a login, PI assesses their context to offer the most convenient passkey experience. It might prioritize a device's built-in authenticator (like Face ID or Windows Hello) or prepare a cross-device flow if the user is on a new computer where no local passkey is available.
-   **Passkey Creation**: During the passkey creation process, PI works to ensure a high success rate. It can prevent common errors, such as a user trying to create a passkey that already exists on their device. It also manages how frequently users are prompted to create a passkey, avoiding excessive reminders for those who have previously opted out.
