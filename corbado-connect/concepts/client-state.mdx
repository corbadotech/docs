Whenever a user completes a passkey ceremony (e.g., appending or logging in with a passkey), the **Corbado Connect UI components** return a string called `clientState`. This `clientState` contains environment-related information (e.g., details used to optimize One-tap, passkey usage and detect environments) so that future interactions can be streamlined and personalized.

- **Purpose**: The `clientState` lets Corbado remember certain details from the user's current device and environment. For example, if passkey usage was already confirmed, or if certain One-tap flows are possible on this device, re-running all checks can be skipped the next time the user interacts with your passkey UI.
- **Persistence**: By default, Corbado automatically stores the `clientState` in the browser's `localStorage`. The strongest persistence is a first-party cookie. Passing the stored `clientState` back into any future **Corbado Connect UI component** will speed up environment detection and reduce friction for repeat passkey usage.

When you render the **Corbado Connect UI component** again, retrieve that `clientState` and provide it to the **Corbado Connect UI component** to enable faster load times and a more seamless passkey flow. By leveraging `clientState` across sessions, you ensure that your users are offered an optimal passkey experience (including One-tap passkey logins) without having to repeat environment checks or initial detections on every visit. This is typically a great booster for the login conversion rate of the solution.
