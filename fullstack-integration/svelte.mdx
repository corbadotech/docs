## Setup Corbado

Disable SSR for pages importing Corbado as it is not yet supported.
We are working on SSR support and will update this guide once it is available.

```ts routes/+layout.server.ts
export const ssr = false;
```

To inform the rest of our application of Corbado loading status, we will create a store.

```ts src/corbadoStore.ts
import { writable } from 'svelte/store';

export const isCorbadoLoaded = writable(false);
```

Now, load Corbado in your root layout to make it available throughout your application.

```html routes/+layout.svelte
<script lang="ts">
    import Corbado from "@corbado/web-js";
    import {onMount} from "svelte";
    import {PUBLIC_CORBADO_PROJECT_ID} from '$env/static/public';
    import {isCorbadoLoaded} from "../corbadoStore";

    onMount(async () => {
        await Corbado.load({
            projectId: PUBLIC_CORBADO_PROJECT_ID,
            darkMode: 'off',
            setShortSessionCookie: true
        });
        $isCorbadoLoaded = true;
    });
</script>

<div>
    <slot />
</div>
```

<CorbadoProviderReference isWebJS={true} />

## Next

1. Add [authentication UI components](/fullstack-integration/svelte/corbadoauth) to your application.
2. Let your users manage their passkeys with the [PasskeyList](/fullstack-integration/svelte/passkeylist).
3. Learn how you can access the users authentication state on the [client-side](/fullstack-integration/svelte/authentication-state-client).
4. Easily [access user information on the server-side](/fullstack-integration/svelte/authentication-state-server)
with the [Node.js SDK](/backend-integration/node-js-sdk).
