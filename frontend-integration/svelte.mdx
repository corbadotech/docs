## Setup Corbado

Disable SSR for pages importing Corbado as it is not yet supported.
We are working on SSR support and will update this guide once it is available.

```ts routes/+layout.server.ts
export const ssr = false;
```

Initialize Corbado in your root layout to make it available throughout your application.

```html routes/+layout.svelte
<script lang="ts">
    import Corbado from "@corbado/web-js";
    import { onMount } from "svelte";
    import { PUBLIC_CORBADO_PROJECT_ID } from '$env/static/public';

    let isInitialized = false;
    onMount(async () => {
        await Corbado.load({
            projectId: PUBLIC_CORBADO_PROJECT_ID,
            darkMode: 'off',
            setShortSessionCookie: true
        });
        isInitialized = true; // Set to true once Corbado is initialized
    });
</script>

<div>
    {#if isInitialized}
        <slot></slot>
    {/if}
</div>
```
<Note>
    Most customization is done in the `Corbado.load` function.
    See a full list of options for the `Corbado.load` function in the [web-js
    documentation](/frontend-integration/ui-components/corbadoprovider).
