## Flutter Package

The [corbado_auth](https://github.com/corbado/flutter-passkeys/tree/main/packages/corbado_auth) package provides you with an authentication SDK that fully integrates with Corbado's relying party server. Therefore, 'corbado_auth' is the easiest way to bring passkeys to your Flutter app. All you need to do is to set up your Corbado project and install `corbado_auth`.;

With `corbado_auth` you can:

* sign up and login users with [passkeys](https://www.corbado.com/glossary/passkey)
* login users with [conditional UI](https://www.corbado.com/glossary/conditional-ui)
* use email one-time passcodes (OTP) as a [fallback](/helpful-guides/passkeys/fallback-options) mechanism for cases when passkeys cannot be used

Find more details on how to integrate this package on its [docs page](https://pub.dev/packages/corbado\_auth).

**Supported platforms:** Android, iOS, Web

**Working example:** [GitHub](https://github.com/corbado/flutter-passkeys/tree/main/packages/corbado\_auth/example)

**Use case:**

Use this package if you want to build a native app that makes use of passkeys for authentication.&#x20;

If you want to use your own relying party server, then you should use the `passkeys` package. If you use Firebase already, then you should use `corbado_auth_firebase`.
