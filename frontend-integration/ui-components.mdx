Our latest components are available for the following frameworks / technologies:

* [React](./react/) and [Next.js](./next.js/)
* [VanillaJS](./vanilla-js/)

**Note:** You can still use Corbado with other frameworks (e.g. [Vue.js](./vue.js), [Svelte](./svelte), [Angular](./angular)) by using our web js package. Find the related docs [here](./vanilla-js).
