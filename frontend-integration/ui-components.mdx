Corbado helps you to add passkeys to your sign-up and to your login. This involves taking care of all the passkey operations itself and fallback methods for cases when passkeys can not be used.

As all of this involves a lot of complex UI, Corbado provides you with prebuilt and configurable **UI components**.


Our latest components are available for the following frameworks / technologies:

* [React](/frontend-integration/react) and [Next.js](/frontend-integration/next.js)
* [VanillaJS](/frontend-integration/vanilla-js)

**Note:** You can still use Corbado with other frameworks (e.g. [Vue.js](/frontend-integration/vue.js), [Svelte](/frontend-integration/svelte), [Angular](/frontend-integration/angular)) by using our web js package. Find the related docs [here](/frontend-integration/vanilla-js).
