| load                | Promise\<void>                             | Initializes the SDK. Takes your `projectId` as a mandatory parameter. For a list of additional optional parameters take a look at the [API reference of CorbadoProvider](/frontend-integration/ui-components/corbadoprovider#api-reference) (they share the same parameters). `Load` must be called before you can use any of the other methods. |
| mountAuthUI         | void                                       | Mounts the [CorbadoAuth](/frontend-integration/ui-components/corbadoauth) component to your DOM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| mountSignUpUI       | void                                       | Mounts the [SignUp](/frontend-integration/ui-components/signup) component to your DOM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| mountLoginUI        | void                                       | Mounts the [Login](/frontend-integration/ui-components/login) component to your DOM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| mountPasskeyList    | void                                       | Mounts the [PasskeyList](/frontend-integration/ui-components/passkeylist) component to your DOM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| isAuthenticated     | boolean                                    | Indicates if the user is logged in. Changes when a user logs in, logs out, or when her session expires.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| user                | SessionUser \| undefined                   | An object that holds basic information about the user. A value of `undefined` indicates that the user is not logged in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| shortSession        | string \| undefined                        | A JWT that proves that the user is authenticated. It can be used to make calls to your backend and thus should be included as an Authorization Header in the requests to such a backend. A value of `undefined` indicates that the user is not logged in.                                                                                        |
| authStateChanges    | BehaviourSubject\<AuthState>               | Like isAuthenticated, it also indicates if the user is logged in. As it is a [BehaviourSubject](https://www.learnrxjs.io/learn-rxjs/subjects/behaviorsubject), you can listen to it to be informed about changes to the user's authentication state.                                                                                             |
| userChanges         | BehaviourSubject \<SessionUser\|undefined> | Listen to userChanges to be informed about changes to the `user` object. As this object is derived from the shortSession, it changes every time the session is refreshed by the SDK.                                                                                                                                                             |
| shortSessionChanges | BehaviourSubject \<string\|undefined>      | Listen to shortSessionChanges to be informed about changes to the `shortSession` object. It changes every time the session is refreshed by the SDK.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| logout              | void                                       | Logs the user out of your application and cleans all local authentication state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
