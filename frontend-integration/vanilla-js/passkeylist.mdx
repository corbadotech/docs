<Warning>
    Before we can begin to render the AuthenticationUI, the `Corbado.load` call has to resolve.
    Find more [here](/frontend-integration/vanilla-js).
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Before we can begin to render the Corbado Passkeylist UI, the `Corbado.load` call has to resolve.

## Passkeylist

The Passkeylist allows the user to view and manage their passkeys.
He can delete existing passkeys or create new ones.
This can be useful if the user wants to have individual passkeys for multiple devices, or erase ones
that are no longer needed.

```html main.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <link
        rel="stylesheet"
        href="https://unpkg.com/@corbado/web-js@2/dist/bundle/index.css"
    />
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@corbado/web-js@2/dist/bundle/index.js"></script>
<body>
    <script type="module">
        await Corbado.load({
            projectId: "pro-XXX",
        });
        const passkeyListElement = document.getElementById("passkeyList");
        Corbado.mountPasskeyListUI(passkeyListElement);
    </script>
    <div id="passkeyList"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

<Note>
    You customize the appearance of the PasskeyList UI in the `Corbado.load` function.
    Find more info [here](/ui-components/corbadoprovider).
