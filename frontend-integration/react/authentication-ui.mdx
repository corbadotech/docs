## Authentication UI

The Authentication UI allows the user to log in or register with Corbado.
Once the user is logged in, the `onLoggedIn` callback is executed.

```tsx components/Auth.tsx
import { CorbadoAuth } from "@corbado/react";

export default function Auth() {
    const onLoggedIn = () => {
        //post login actions like navigation can be performed here.
        console.log("User is logged in");
    };

    return <CorbadoAuth onLoggedIn={onLoggedIn} />;
}
```

<Note>
    You customize the appearance of the Authentication UI in the `CorbadoProvider`.
    Find more info [here](/ui-components/configuration/corbadoprovider).
