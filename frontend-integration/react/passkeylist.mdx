## Passkeylist

The Passkeylist allows the user to view and manage their passkeys.
He can delete existing passkeys or create new ones.
This can be useful if the user wants to have individual passkeys for multiple devices, or erase ones
that are no longer needed.

```tsx components/passkey-management.tsx
import { PasskeyList } from "@corbado/react";

export default function PasskeyManagement() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Manage your Passkeys</h1>
            <PasskeyList />
        </div>
    );
}
```

<Note>
    You customize the appearance of the Passkeylist UI in the `CorbadoProvider`.
    Find more info [here](/ui-components/configuration/corbadoprovider).
