After setting up Corbado in your React application, you now want to access authentication state and you want to use Corbado's SDK to trigger certain authentication related functions (e.g. a logout). All of these functions and some basic state are exposed by the `useCorbado()` hook.

It gives you access to the following state:

| State           | Type    | Description                                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| isAuthenticated | boolean | Indicates if the user is logged in.                                                                                                  |
| loading         | boolean | If true, the SDK is still in a loading state. You should then not yet make use of the other states but wait until `loading = false`. |

This is a very simple example that shows how you can use this hook to render a page that depends on the user's authentication state.

```tsx HomePage.tsx
import { useCorbado } from "@corbado/react";
function HomePage() {
  const { loading, isAuthenticated, logout } = useCorbado();
  if (loading) {
    return <p>Loading...</p>;
  }

  return (
    <>
      <p>You are logged in.</p>
      <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

Additionally, you can use it to trigger the following operations:

| Name                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| logout                     | Logs the user out of your application and cleans all local authentication state.                                                                                                                  |
| userExists                 | Returns true if a user (identified by her user identifier) already exists in your system.                                                                                                         |
| initSignUpWithEmailOTP     | Initiates a signup based on an email OTP challenge. This will trigger an email that is sent to the user.                                                                                          |
| completeSignUpWithEmailOTP | Complete the email OTP signup.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| initLoginWithEmailOTP      | Initiates a login based on an email OTP challenge. This will trigger an email that is sent to the user.                                                                                           |
| completeLoginWithEmailOTP  | Complete the email OTP login.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| signUpWithPasskey          | Initiates a signup based on a passkey challenge.                                                                                                                                                  |
| loginWithPasskey           | Initiates a login based on a passkey challenge.                                                                                                                                                   |
| loginWithConditionalUI     | Initiates a login based on conditional UI. This is still a passkey based one, but the user is shown a list of all available passkeys so she does not have to provide the user identifier herself. |
| appendPasskey              | Creates a new passkey for an already authenticated user. This only works if the user has not already set up another passkey for the same device.                                                  |
| getPasskeys                | Get all passkeys that are available for the current user.                                                                                                                                         |
| deletePasskey              | Delete a passkey for the current user.                                                                                                                                                            |

**Note:**

- Our UI components calls most of these functions for you (you only need to trigger the logout function yourself).&#x20;
- Only if you want to build your custom UI components there is a need to make use of these operations yourself.
