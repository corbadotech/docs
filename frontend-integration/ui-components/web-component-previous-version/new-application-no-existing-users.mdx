## Authenticate the user

<Note>
This authentication part (steps 1-2) is the same to authentication with an existing user base.
</Note>

1. [Redirect user to Redirect URL](#1-redirect-user-to-redirect-url)
2. [Session management](#2-session-management)

### 1. Redirect user to Redirect URL

On successful authentication (e.g. with passkeys or email magic link), the user is redirected to the [Redirect URL](/helpful-guides/url-overview#3-redirect-url) in the browser.

### 2. Session management

If the user has successfully authenticated and been redirected to the Redirect URL, you need to take care of session management for your application.&#x20;

Here, you have two options:

#### 2.1 Corbado session management

<Note>
We recommend to read through the general [Corbado session documentation](/sessions/overview) before implementation.
</Note>

Corbado offers secure and easy session management that you can use out-of-the-box.

Depending on your application's setup, you have different choices for protecting routes with Corbado's session management. Please see [Sessions - Protecting routes](/sessions/protecting-routes) for details.

#### 2.2 Own session management

<Note>
If you have **no existing user base**, we strongly recommend to use [Corbado's session management](/sessions/overview), as this will save you a lot of implementation time and is a proven solution.
</Note>

If you want to keep your existing session management, you can keep that of course and use Corbado only for authentication. Please see [Own session management](/sessions/own-session-management) for details.
