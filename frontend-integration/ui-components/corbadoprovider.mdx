### API reference

| Name                  | Type              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| projectId             | string (e.g. pro-1234567890) | The ID of your Corbado project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| autoDetectLanguage    | boolean                      | If set to `true` the language used in UI components will be derived from the browser.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| defaultLanguage       | string (en\|de\|fr)          | If set to a language other than "en" (the default) all wordings will be translated to that language. By default, Corbado supports "en", "de" and "fr". You can define your custom translations though.                                                |
| customTranslations    | object                       | A map from language (e.g. "en") to an object containing your custom translation overrides.                                                                                                                                                            |
| darkMode              | string (on\|off\|auto)       | Controls if your components are rendered in dark mode. If set to `auto` the darkMode setting will be derived from the browser.                                                                                                                        |
| theme                 | string                       | Controls the style of your components. Currently the only alternative theme that can be set here is `emerald-funk`. You can create your own custom theme though (find more details below).                                                            |
| isDevMode             | boolean                      | Defaults to false. If set to true, the UI components will log debug messages to console. Some of them (`<CorbadoAuth>`, `<Login>`, `<SignUp>`) will also display more detailed error messages on their error screen (see error screen section below). |
| customerSupportEmail  | string                       | If defined, the error screens will include this email address (see error screen section below).                                                                                                                                                       |
| frontendApiUrl        | string                       | Please set this value when you go live to your defined [CNAME](/helpful-guides/url-overview#5-cname). By default it is automatically set to your [Frontend API](/overview/corbado-api-structure/frontend-api) URL.                         |
| setShortSessionCookie | boolean                      | If set to true, a cbo_short_session cookie will be set automatically be the Corbado component for the current domain. This makes sense if you are running a full stack application (e.g. NextJS) or a multi page application (e.g. PHP).              |

| Name                | Type                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| load                | Promise\<void>                             | Initializes the SDK. Takes your `projectId` as a mandatory parameter. For a list of additional optional parameters take a look at the [API reference of CorbadoProvider](/frontend-integration/ui-components/corbadoprovider#api-reference) (they share the same parameters). `Load` must be called before you can use any of the other methods. |
| isAuthenticated     | boolean                                    | Indicates if the user is logged in. Changes when a user logs in, logs out, or when her session expires.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| user                | SessionUser \| undefined                   | An object that holds basic information about the user. A value of `undefined` indicates that the user is not logged in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| shortSession        | string \| undefined                        | A JWT that proves that the user is authenticated. It can be used to make calls to your backend and thus should be included as an Authorization Header in the requests to such a backend. A value of `undefined` indicates that the user is not logged in.                                                                                                               |
| authStateChanges    | BehaviourSubject\<AuthState>               | Like isAuthenticated, it also indicates if the user is logged in. As it is a [BehaviourSubject](https://www.learnrxjs.io/learn-rxjs/subjects/behaviorsubject), you can listen to it to be informed about changes to the user's authentication state.                                                                                                                    |
| userChanges         | BehaviourSubject \<SessionUser\|undefined> | Listen to userChanges to be informed about changes to the `user` object. As this object is derived from the shortSession, it changes every time the session is refreshed by the SDK.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| shortSessionChanges | BehaviourSubject \<string\|undefined>      | Listen to shortSessionChanges to be informed about changes to the `shortSession` object. It changes every time the session is refreshed by the SDK.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| logout              | void                                       | Logs the user out of your application and cleans all local authentication state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| mountAuthUI         | void                                       | Mounts the [\<CorbadoAuth/>](/frontend-integration/ui-components/corbadoauth) component to your DOM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| mountSignUpUI       | void                                       | Mounts the [\<SignUp/>](/frontend-integration/ui-components/signup) component to your DOM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| mountLoginUI        | void                                       | Mounts the [\<Login/>](/frontend-integration/ui-components/login) component to your DOM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| mountPasskeyList    | void                                       | Mounts the [\<PasskeyList/>](/frontend-integration/ui-components/passkeylist) component to your DOM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
