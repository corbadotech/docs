title: "CorbadoProvider"
description: "The CorbadoProvider component provides global configuration for all your Corbado UI Components."
---

## Introduction

This component is **required** for integrating any other UI Component (e.g., Signup, Login, etc.). Unlike other components, it exclusively handles global configuration for all other UI components without rendering any UI elements. {/* (given that they are wrapped with React \<CorbadoProvider/>, or set in the Glo).*/}

The `CorbadoProvider` component is defined
- in **React** as `<CorbadoProvider />` 
- in **VanillaJS** as `Corbado.load()`

## Example

Find here an example how to implement the `CorbadoProvider` in your application.

<CodeGroup>

```tsx React
import { CorbadoProvider } from '@corbado/react';
import { RouterProvider } from 'react-router-dom';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <CorbadoProvider
        projectId="pro-XXX"
        /*Add here further optional configurations*/
    >
      <RouteProvider />
    </CorbadoProvider>
  );
}
```

```html VanillaJS
<script type="module">
  Corbado.load({
    projectId: "pro-XXX",
    /*Add here further optional configurations*/
  });
</script>
```

</CodeGroup>



## API reference
Here are the API references for the CorbadoProvider in both **React** and **VanillaJS**.



| Name                  | Type              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| projectId             | string (e.g. pro-1234567890) | The ID of your Corbado project. This setting is **mandatory** and can be found in the Developer Panel.                                                                                                                                                |
| autoDetectLanguage    | boolean                      | If set to `true` the language used in UI components will be derived from the browser.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| defaultLanguage       | string (en\|de\|fr)          | If set to a language other than "en" (the default) all wordings will be translated to that language. By default, Corbado supports "en", "de" and "fr". You can define custom translations though.                                                |
| customTranslations    | object                       | A map from language (e.g. "en") to an object containing your custom translation overrides. Find more details [here](/frontend-integration/ui-components/customization#1-custom-translations)                                                                                                                                                            |
| darkMode              | string (on\|off\|auto)       | Controls if your components are rendered in dark mode. If set to `auto` the darkMode setting will be derived from the browser.                                                                                                                        |
| theme                 | string                       | Controls the style of your components. Currently, the only alternative theme that can be set here is `emerald-funk`. To create your own custom theme find all information [here](/frontend-integration/ui-components/customization#2-custom-themes).                                                            |
| isDevMode             | boolean                      | Defaults to false. If set to true, the UI components will log debug messages to console. Some of them (`CorbadoAuth`, `Login`, `SignUp`) will also display more detailed error messages on their error screen (see [error screen](/frontend-integration/ui-components/customization#3-error-screen) section). |
| frontendApiUrl        | string                       | Please set this value when you go live to your defined [CNAME](/helpful-guides/url-overview#5-cname). By default it is automatically set to your [Frontend API](/overview/corbado-api-structure/frontend-api) URL.                         |
| setShortSessionCookie | boolean                      | If set to true, a `cbo_short_session` cookie will be set automatically by the Corbado component for the current domain. This setting makes sense if you are running a full stack application (e.g. Next.js) or a multi page application (e.g. PHP).              |

| load                | Promise\<void>                             | Initializes the SDK. Takes your `projectId` as a mandatory parameter. For a list of additional optional parameters take a look at the [API reference of CorbadoProvider](/frontend-integration/ui-components/corbadoprovider#api-reference) (they share the same parameters). `Load` must be called before you can use any of the other methods. |
| isAuthenticated     | boolean                                    | Indicates if the user is logged in. Changes when a user logs in, logs out, or when her session expires.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| user                | SessionUser \| undefined                   | An object that holds basic information about the user. A value of `undefined` indicates that the user is not logged in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| shortSession        | string \| undefined                        | A JWT that proves that the user is authenticated. It can be used to make calls to your backend and thus should be included as an Authorization Header in the requests to such a backend. A value of `undefined` indicates that the user is not logged in.                                                                                                               |
| authStateChanges    | BehaviourSubject\<AuthState>               | Like isAuthenticated, it also indicates if the user is logged in. As it is a [BehaviourSubject](https://www.learnrxjs.io/learn-rxjs/subjects/behaviorsubject), you can listen to it to be informed about changes to the user's authentication state.                                                                                                                    |
| userChanges         | BehaviourSubject \<SessionUser\|undefined> | Listen to userChanges to be informed about changes to the `user` object. As this object is derived from the shortSession, it changes every time the session is refreshed by the SDK.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| shortSessionChanges | BehaviourSubject \<string\|undefined>      | Listen to shortSessionChanges to be informed about changes to the `shortSession` object. It changes every time the session is refreshed by the SDK.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| logout              | void                                       | Logs the user out of your application and cleans all local authentication state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| mountSignUpUI       | void                                       | Mounts the [Signup](/frontend-integration/ui-components/signup) component to your DOM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
