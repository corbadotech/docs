## Introduction

![PasskeyList Component](/images/frontend-integration/ui-components/passkeylist/passkeylist.webp)

The \<PasskeyList/> component lists all passkeys that a user has created and that are thus available to them. The user can delete these existing passkeys and add new ones.

<CodeGroup>

```tsx Typescript
import { PasskeyList } from '@corbado/react';

const PasskeyPage = () => {
  return (
    <PasskeyList />
  );
};

```

```html VanillaJS
<script>
  const passkeyListElement = document.getElementById('passkey-list');

  if (Corbado.user) {
    Corbado.mountPasskeyListUI(passkeyListElement);
  }
</script>

<div id="passkey-list"></div>
```

</CodeGroup>

You can embed this component somewhere in the user's profile page and thus give them control over their passkeys.&#x20;
