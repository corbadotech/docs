![PasskeyList Component](/images/frontend-integration/ui-components/passkeylist/passkeylist.webp)


## Introduction

The `PasskeyList` component lists all passkeys that a user has created and that are thus available to them. The user can delete these existing passkeys and add new ones.

The PasskeyList component allows an application to add only one passkey per device.

## Example
<CodeGroup>

```tsx Typescript
import { PasskeyList } from '@corbado/react';

const PasskeyPage = () => {
  return (
    <PasskeyList />
  );
};

```

```html VanillaJS
<script>
  const passkeyListElement = document.getElementById('passkey-list');

  if (Corbado.user) {
    Corbado.mountPasskeyListUI(passkeyListElement);
  }
</script>

<div id="passkey-list"></div>
```

</CodeGroup>

You can embed this component somewhere in the user's profile page and thus give them control over their passkeys.&#x20;

<Note> This component requires the `CorbadoProvider` component. Most configuration settings will be applied there so make sure to check out the available settings of the [Corbado Provider](/frontend-integration/ui-components/corbadoprovider). </Note>
