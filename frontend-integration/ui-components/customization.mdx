## Customization Options for UI Components

Corbado provides the following customization options:

-   [1. Custom translation](/frontend-integration/ui-components/customization#1-custom-translations)
-   [2. Custom styling](/frontend-integration/ui-components/customization#2-custom-styling)

Customization options are configured in the [CorbadoProvider](/frontend-integration/ui-components/corbadoprovider).

## 1. Custom translations

Custom translations can serve two main purposes:

-   Support other languages
-   Customize the standard texts of the components

For both cases, you add your custom translation by creating your own translation file. To see the structure of a translation file, please take a look at our default translations for "en" [here](https://github.com/corbado/javascript/blob/develop/packages/shared-ui/src/i18n/en.json).

By setting the `autoDetectLanguage` to **true** in the `CorbadoProvider` component, the component can automatically detect a user's browser language and adjust all wordings accordingly.
If a language is not supported by Corbado yet, the component will default to "en".

```typescript Custom Translations
const en = {
    signup: {
        "signup-init": {
            "signup-init": {
                header: "Let's create an account",
                subheader: "to check ",
                text_login: "Would you like to login? ",
                button_submit: "Sign up",
                textField_fullName: "Full Name",
                text_divider: "or use social logins"
            }
        }
    },
    login: {
        "login-init": {
            "login-init": {
                header: "Please login",
                subheader: "to check ",
                text_signup: "Would you like to create an account? ",
                button_signup: "Sign up",
                button_submit: "Login"
            }
        }
    },
    passkeysList: {
        button_createPasskey: "You can create passkeys here.",
        field_credentialId: "ID: ",
        field_status: "Status of Passkey: "
    }
};

export default en;
```

To use this translation now, supply it to the [CorbadoProvider](/frontend-integration/ui-components/corbadoprovider).

<CodeGroup>

```tsx React
import { CorbadoProvider } from "@corbado/react";
import englishTranslations from "./translations/en";

const App = () => {
    return (
        <CorbadoProvider
            projectId="pro-XXX"
            customTranslations={{
                en: englishTranslations
            }}
        >
            /** Your application **/
        </CorbadoProvider>
    );
};
```

```html VanillaJS
<script type="module">
    Corbado.load({
        projectId: "pro-XXX",
        customTranslations: {
            en: englishTranslations
        }
    });
</script>
```

## 2. Custom styling

Corbado offers multiple ways to customize the styling of the UI components. You can adjust the styling through the following settings:

-   [2.1 Configuring dark-mode](/frontend-integration/ui-components/customization#2-1-configuring-darkmode)
-   [2.2 Switching the theme](/frontend-integration/ui-components/customization#2-2-switching-the-theme)
-   [2.3 Creating a custom theme](/frontend-integration/ui-components/customization#2-3-creating-a-custom-theme)

### 2.1 Configuring dark-mode

For every theme, there is styling for dark and for light mode. Which of these themes is applied depends on your configuration for the `darkMode` parameter in the `CorbadoProvider`.<br/> You can set the `darkMode` to `on|off|auto`. If set to `auto` the darkMode setting will be derived from the browser.

### 2.2 Switching the theme

Currently, Corbado offers two themes out of the box:

-   default
-   emerald-funk

You can pass the theme to the CorbadoProvider `theme` setting. If no setting is passed, the default theme is used.
Currently the only alternative theme is `emerald-funk`.

### 2.3 Creating a custom theme

If you need more customization, you can create your own theme. To do so, create one parent CSS class named after your theme (e.g. "your-custom-theme").

Inside this class you can now overwrite all the Corbado classes. Every Corbado class is prefixed with "cb-" so you can easily identify them.

<Tip>
    If you want to change the styling of a particular part of the UI components
    but you don't know the classname, just use your browser's "inspect" tool
    from the developer tools.
</Tip>

```css Custome Theme
.your-custom-theme {
    --cb-box-color: #3f465d;
    --cb-primary-color-hover: #1145df80;
    --cb-primary-color-disabled: #6f7486;
    --cb-script-text-color: #d0d9f5;
    --cb-box-color-hover: #525d83;

    .cb-container {
        width: 500px;
    }

    .cb-error-popup {
        gap: 1rem;
        padding: 2rem 3rem;
    }
}
```

Finally, configure the [CorbadoProvider](/frontend-integration/ui-components/corbadoprovider) component to use the theme.

<CodeGroup>

```tsx React
import { CorbadoProvider } from "@corbado/react";

const App = () => {
    return (
        <CorbadoProvider projectId="pro-XXX" theme="your-custom-theme">
            /** Your application **/
        </CorbadoProvider>
    );
};
```

```html VanillaJS
<script type="module">
    Corbado.load({
        projectId: "pro-XXX",
        theme: "your-custom-theme"
    });
</script>
```

</CodeGroup>

## FAQs

### Dark mode customizations not loading in production

This can happen if your custom CSS is loading before the `.cb-dark` class from the Corbado package is loaded by the browser. It can be fixed by increasing the specificity of the custom class like with `.cb-dark.your-custom-theme`

### Icon colors not applied in `web-js` package when using `<script />` tag

We use the `windows.atob` function which decodes a string of Base64-encoded data into bytes. This is used to convert Base64 SVG images to HTML SVG elements and then apply custom styling to them.
In case of using `web-js` package with inline `<script />` tag this is not allowed by the browsers and thus customised colors cannot be applied to SVGs for now in these types of applications.
