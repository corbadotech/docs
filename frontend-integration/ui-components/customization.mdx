### Custom translations

You can configure our components to automatically detect a user's browser language and to change all wordings accordingly. If a language is not supported by Corbado yet, the component will default to "en". You can add your custom translation by creating your own translation file. You can use custom translations also in cases where you just want to override parts of the wording.

For a definition of the current structure of our translation files, please take a look at our default translations for "en" [here](https://github.com/corbado/javascript/blob/main/packages/shared-ui/src/i18n/en.json).

```typescript Custom Translations
const en = {
  signup: {
    signup-init: {
      signup-init: {
        header: "Create your account",
        subheader: "to access ",
        text_login: "You already have an account? ",
        button_login: "Log in",
        button_submit: "Continue",
        textField_fullName: "Name",
        textField_username: "Username",
        textField_email: "Email address",
        textField_phone: "Phone number",
        text_divider: "or",
        },
      },
    },
  login: {
    login-init: {
      login-init: {
        header: "Log in",
        subheader: "to access ",
        text_signup: "No account? ",
        button_signup: "Sign up",
        button_submit: "Continue",
        textField: {
          email: "Email address",
          username: "Username",
          emailOrUsername: "Email address or username",
          phone: "Phone number"
          },
        },
      },
    },
};

export default en;
```

To use this translation now, supply it to the [Corbado Provider](/frontend-integration/ui-components/corbadoprovider).

<CodeGroup>

```tsx React
import { CorbadoProvider } from '@corbado/react';
import englishTranslations from './translations/en';
import { RouterProvider } from 'react-router-dom';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <CorbadoProvider
      projectId="pro-XXX"
      customTranslations={{
        en: englishTranslations,
      }}
    >
      <RouteProvider />
    </CorbadoProvider>
  );
```

```html VanillaJS
<script type="module">
  Corbado.load({
    projectId: "pro-XXX",
    customTranslations: {
      en: englishTranslations,
    },
  });
</script>
```

</CodeGroup>

### Custom themes

Before we show how to create custom themes, let's take a step back first and take a look at what options you have in general to influence the styling of Corbado's UI components.

This can be done in three different ways:

#### 1. Switching the theme

Currently, Corbado offers two themes out of the box:

- default
- emerald-funk

#### 2. Configuring darkMode

For every theme, there is styling for dark and for light mode. Which of these is applied depends on your configuration for the `darkMode` parameter.

#### 3. Creating a custom theme

If you need more customisation, you can create your own theme. To do this, create one parent CSS class named after your theme (e.g. "your-custom-theme).&#x20;

Inside this class you can now overwrite all the corbado classes. Every Corbado class is prefixed with "cb-" so you can easily identify them.&#x20;

**Note:** If you want to change the styling of a particular part of the UI components but you don't know the classname, just use your browser's "inspect" tool from the developer tools.



```css Custome Theme
.your-custom-theme {
  .cb-container {
    background-color: var(--color-white);
    color: var(--color-black);
    border-color: var(--color-dark-brown);
  }

  .cb-header,
  .cb-subheader,
  .cb-body {
    font-family: var(--font-eloquent);
    color: var(--color-black);
  }

  .cb-link-primary {
    color: var(--color-light-brown);
  }

  .cb-link-secondary {
    color: var(--color-dark-brown);
  }
}
```

Finally, configure the [Corbado Provider](/frontend-integration/ui-components/corbadoprovider) component to use the theme.

<CodeGroup>

```tsx React
import { CorbadoProvider } from '@corbado/react';
import englishTranslations from './translations/en';
import { RouterProvider } from 'react-router-dom';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <CorbadoProvider
      projectId="pro-XXX"
      theme='your-custom-theme'
    >
      <RouteProvider />
    </CorbadoProvider>
  );
```

```html VanillaJS
<script type="module">
  Corbado.load({
    projectId: "pro-XXX",
    theme: "your-custom-theme",
  });
</script>
```

</CodeGroup>

### Error screen

If an error occurs that can not be handled by the UI component (e.g. by making a retry or by offering the user a fallback option), it will show an error screen.&#x20;

Depending on your setting of isDevMode, the error screen is rendered in two variants (left is in development mode, right is in production mode):
