import CorbadoProviderReference from "/snippets/corbadoprovider-api-reference.mdx";

## Installation

First, you need to [set up a Corbado project](/overview/getting-started).
To get started with the integration, either install the Corbado web-js package via npm or add the JavaScript
library via CDN.

<CodeGroup>

```bash NPM
npm install @corbado/web-js
```

```html CDN
<!-- Include the following lines in the head section of your html  -->
<!-- @2 loads the most recent version of major version 2
Replace @2 with a specific version number if you want to pin it.
Use @latest if you always want to have the most recent version including majors (not recommended for production). -->
<link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://unpkg.com/@corbado/web-js@2/dist/bundle/index.css"
/>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@corbado/web-js@2/dist/bundle/index.js"></script>
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
    Note: UI components added via **CDN** do currently not support icon coloring
    which may impact dark mode and other custom UI stylings.
</Note>

## Setup Corbado

As a prerequisite to all future actions, Corbado has to be loaded.
We do this by using the [Corbado.load](/frontend-integration/vanilla-js) function.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <link
        rel="stylesheet"
        href="https://unpkg.com/@corbado/web-js@2/dist/bundle/index.css"
    />
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@corbado/web-js@2/dist/bundle/index.js"></script>
<body>
    <script type="module">
        await Corbado.load({
            projectId: "pro-XXX"
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

<CorbadoProviderReference isWebJS={true} />

## Next

1. Add [authentication UI components](/frontend-integration/vanilla-js/corbadoauth) to your application.
2. Let your users manage their passkeys with the [PasskeyList](/frontend-integration/vanilla-js/passkeylist).
3. Learn how you can [access the users authentication state](/frontend-integration/vanilla-js/authentication-state).
