title: "Passkeys Analyzer"
description: "Corbado's free passkeys analyzer allows you to find out the passkey-readiness of your users based on data about the device, operating system and browser."

## Overview

Passkeys support is constantly growing as Apple, Google and Microsoft establish passkeys as new login standard. To let you find out how many of your users are "passkey-ready" and thus let you define your passkey transition strategy, we created a free passkeys analyzer.

The passkeys analyzer gives you information about the following data:

1. [User agent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent) (operating system, browser): lets you know which operating system and browser is used by your users
2. [Platform authenticator](https://www.corbado.com/glossary/platform-authenticator): tells you if your users' devices have built-in biometric scanners
3. [Conditional UI](https://www.corbado.com/glossary/conditional-ui): tells you if the users' browsers are able to display [Conditional UI](https://www.corbado.com/blog/webauthn-conditional-ui-passkeys-autofill), which allows to automatically fill in passkeys in login forms

<Note>
Corbado's passkeys analyzer does not store any personal data or uses cookies. All data is completely anonymized and stored in a German data center, thus making it fully GDPR compliant.

## Configuration

To use the passkeys analyzer, you need to create an account in the Corbado [developer panel](https://app.corbado.com/signin#register).

If you sign up, you need to create a new Corbado project. Every project in Corbado will get a unique `project ID` which will be used to analyze the passkey-readiness of your user base.

## 1. Integrate the JavaScript snippet

Corbado will issue you with a JavaScript snippet. This code must appear on every page that you want Corbado to analyze. We recommend that you paste this code in your \<head> (or in a general file that is included in all your pages).

```html
<script>
(function () {
  var script=document.createElement('script');
  script.src="https://analyze.corbado.com/assets/bundle.js";
  script.defer=true
  var head=document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]
  var done=false

  script.onload=script.onreadystatechange = function(){
    if (!done && (!this.readyState || this.readyState == 'loaded' || this.readyState == 'complete') ) {
      done=true;
      tracking.visit({
        projectID: 'pro-1',
      })
      script.onload = script.onreadystatechange = null;
      head.removeChild(script);
    }
  };
  head.appendChild(script);
})()
</script>
```

## 2. Start analyzing the passkey-readiness

Once you have pushed your code to production, Corbado starts analyzing the passkey-readiness of your users. Take a look at the [charts in the developer panel](https://app.corbado.com/app/stats/passkeys-analyzer) to see details.
