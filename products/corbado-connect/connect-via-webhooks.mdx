## Overview

If you want pre-built UX / UI flows in your authentication that you can use instead of your existing UX / UI, you can use the Corbado [web component](/frontend-integration/ui-components/web-component-previous-version/) and connect to your existing authentication system via [webhooks](/products/corbado-connect/connect-via-webhooks/webhooks).

## 1. Follow the web component guide

As you will use the UX / UI from Corbado's web component, please follow the web component frontend integration guide:
