2. [Webhooks requests](#2-webhooks-requests)
3. [Webhooks responses](#3-webhooks-responses)
4. [Webhooks actions](#4-webhooks-actions)
5. [Backend implementation](#5-backend-implementation)

## 1. Webhooks testing (optional)

To ensure that your webhooks are working properly and returning the correct response, you can define test data to check the two most important actions: requesting login information and password verification.

We then constantly monitor your backend ([webhooks URL](/helpful-guides/url-overview#6-webhooks-url)) by making requests (coming soon).

### 1.1 Username and password verification

Please provide a valid pair of username and password. This test will check if the password verification of your existing authentication is connected properly.

### 1.2 Non-existing username

Please provide a username (email address, phone number) that does NOT exist in your database. This test will check if non-existing users are handled properly.

## 2. Webhooks requests

Webhook requests from Corbado sent to your backend follow this payload structure:

```json
{
  "id": "who-1234567890", // Unique ID per webhook request
  "projectID": "pro-1234567890", // Your project ID from the developer panel
  "action": "authMethods", // The specific action of the webhook request, see table below
  "data": {
    // Data object dependent on action
  }
}
```

The action is sent as a header (X-Corbado-Action) as well. This makes it easier for you to unserialize the payload into an action dependent entity / model by taking the action from the header instead of taking it from the payload itself.

## 3. Webhooks responses

Webhook responses from your backend sent to Corbado follow this payload structure:

```json
{
  "responseID": "d5a80602-a771-4532-8cc8-6d4a9003d92a", // A response ID you can set in your backend for debugging
  "data": {
    // Data object dependent on action
  }
}
```

## 4. Webhooks actions

The following webhooks actions exist:

| Action                                                                                          | Description                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [authMethods](/products/corbado-connect/connect-via-webhooks/webhooks/action-authmethods)       | This action returns if the user already exists in the user database and which authentication methods already exist. |
| [passwordVerify](/products/corbado-connect/connect-via-webhooks/webhooks/action-passwordverify) | This action verifies if the provided username and password combination of the existing authentication is valid.     |

## 5. Backend implementation

To make the implementation of the webhook endpoint in your backend as smooth as possible we provide webhook functionality in our SDKs. Plus, they come with entities / models for request and response (dependent on action) and ease authentication handling for you. We highly encourage you to use them.

- [Node.js SDK](/backend-integration/node.js-sdk)
- [Go SDK](/backend-integration/go-sdk)
