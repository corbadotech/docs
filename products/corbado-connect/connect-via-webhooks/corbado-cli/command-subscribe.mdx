Currently the `subscribe` command is the most important one in the Corbado CLI. It lets you subscribe to our tunnel server to receive [webhook ](/products/corbado-connect/connect-via-webhooks/webhooks)requests locally.&#x20;

To fully understand the `subscribe` command you should get familiar with our [webhooks ](/products/corbado-connect/connect-via-webhooks/webhooks)first.

## Problem with local development

Before we start with explaining the command itself let's talk about a problem with local development and the reason why we created the `subscribe` command.

Corbado sends webhook requests to your application. On production this is no problem: your webhook is exposed on the internet (with proper authentication) and Corbado can send webhook requests.

Locally this is not that easy. Let's say you implement your webhook backend with PHP (any other language / technology works as well) and run a local development server:

```sh
php -S localhost:8000
```

Now your application listens on localhost port 8000. You can access your webhook locally but Corbado has **no way to access your local running application** to send webhook requests.&#x20;

## Solution

To solve this problem we created the `subscribe` command which opens a tunnel from your local computer to Corbado. This tunnel is then used to exchange webhook requests and responses.

See the following chart how webhook requests and responses flow through the system:

![command subscribe](/images/products/corbado-connect/connect-via-webhooks/corbado-cli/command-subscribe.webp)


## Command execution

You implemented your webhook in PHP (any other language / technology works as well) and can access it locally via `http://localhost:8000/corbadoWebhookHandler.php` (this is your [webhooks URL](/helpful-guides/url-overview#6-webhooks-url)).

The command execution looks like the following:

```sh
corbado subscribe http://localhost:8000
```

<Warning>
In the CLI `subscribe` command, provide only http://localhost:8000, not the full URL!
</Warning>

<Note>
We did not provide any authentication information, see [authentication ](/products/corbado-connect/connect-via-webhooks/corbado-cli#authentication)methods
</Note>


Next you need to configure the [webhooks URL](/helpful-guides/url-overview#6-webhooks-url) in the [developer panel](https://app.corbado.com/app/settings/webhooks). Here you must set the full URL to `http://localhost:8000/corbadoWebhookHandler.php.`

<Check>
Done: now you can test the full authentication journey!
</Check>


## Technical details

Underneath we use [websockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets\_API?retiredLocale=de) (do not get confused with webhooks) to exchange webhook requests and responses.

The `subscribe` command opens a websocket connection to our tunnel server which itself actually is a websocket server. We use the websocket connection to "tunnel" webhook requests and responses.
