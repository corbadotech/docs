## Overview

The Corbado CLI (command line interface) is a tool which you can run locally on your command line to interact with the Corbado platform. It provides multiple [commands ](./#commands)and runs on [Windows](./#windows), [MacOS ](./#macos)and [Linux](./#linux).

The Corbado CLI is written in [Go](https://go.dev) and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/corbado/cli).

## Installation

To install the Corbado CLI we provide (among the source code version) pre-compiled binaries on our [GitHub release page](https://github.com/corbado/cli/releases/latest).

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Windows">
1. Download the file for `windows` from  [GitHub](https://github.com/corbado/cli/releases/latest)
2. Extract the file: `unzip corbado_cli_[X.X.X]_windows_[Architecture].zip`
3. Run the binary `corbado.exe`

<Note>
You might geht a warning by Microsoft Defender SmartScreen that the execution of an unknown app was stopped. You can ignore the message and run the .exe file.

<Accordion title="macOS">
1. Download the file for `macos` from  [GitHub](https://github.com/corbado/cli/releases/latest)
2. Extract the file: `tar -xvf corbado_cli_[X.X.X]_macos_[Architecture].tar.gz`
3. Run the binary `corbado`
4. Optional: Install the binary in a global reachable directory like `/usr/local/bin`

Because of security reasons the execution of external downloaded binaries from the internet is not allowed. The alert looks like the following:

![macOS Alert](/images/products/corbado-connect/connect-via-webhooks/corbado-cli/macos-alert.webp)

This must be overwritten for Corbado. Go to "System preferences":

![macOS Alert](/images/products/corbado-connect/connect-via-webhooks/corbado-cli/macos-settings.webp)

Click on "Security & Privacy". There you can see that the execution of the `corbado` binary was blocked:

![macOS Alert](/images/products/corbado-connect/connect-via-webhooks/corbado-cli/macos-security-privacy.webp)

Click on "Open Anyway". The following screen will appear:

![macOS Alert](/images/products/corbado-connect/connect-via-webhooks/corbado-cli/macos-alert-2.webp)

Click on "Open" and start the execution of the `corbado` binary. You only have to do it once.

<Warning>

## Authentication

The Corbado CLI needs to authenticate. For this you need to provide your **`projectID`** and a **`cliSecret`**. There is exactly one `cliSecret` per project and you can find it on our [developer panel](https://app.corbado.com/app/settings/credentials/cli-secret).

There are multiple authentication methods. They are checked in order, first come first serve. So if you provide flags they overwrite environment variables and they overwrite the credential file.

<Info>
Of course, you only need to use one of the methods.
</Info>

| Method                | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Flags                 | You can provide the `projectID` and `cliSecret` via **`--projectID pro-XXX`** and **`--cliSecret XXX`**                                           |
| Environment variables | You can set the `projectID` in the environment variable **`CORBADO_PROJECT_ID`** and the `cliSecret` in **`CORBADO_CLI_SECRET`**                  |
| Credential file       | You can save the `projectID` and `cliSecret` to a credential file locally, see [login ](command-login.md)and [logout ](command-logout.md)commands |

## Commands

Currently the following commands are provided:

| Command                           |                                                                                                                       |
