## Overview

Corbado Complete is a full, standalone passkey-first authentication solution that can be used if you don't have any authentication in your app yet or want to completely replace your existing authentication solution. All data is stored in the cloud.

## Use cases

Corbado Complete works best **for new apps** and is the ideal choice if you want:

1. **Get auth done in 1 sprint:** Standalone auth to cover all your auth, session and user management needs
2. **No passwords:** Never lose a customer again due to forgotten passwords, win them forever and boost security
3. **New standard:** Follow large tech companies like Google, GitHub and TikTok as most users and devices are passkey-ready today

## How to start?
