## Overview

Corbado Connect allows you to easily add passkeys to your existing app, without changing your UX or replacing your entire authentication system. Thus, it's perfect for adding passkeys with no risk and gradually transitioning your users to passkeys.

  [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/corbado/shared_invite/zt-2g4etyvxi-otKksMmhMHwWK19aCbhODQ) if
  you want to migrate your entire user base completly to Corbado.

## Use Cases

Corbado Connect works best **for existing apps** and is the ideal choice to:

1. **Win customers forever:** Improve login conversion today and stay connected to your customers forever via their keychain
2. **No migration**: Keep your user data / auth system and own the UX flows while only adding passkeys via low-code plugin
3. **No risk:** Continue to use existing auth methods (e.g. passwords) to avoid any friction

## How to start?

Currently, two integration ways are offered (more coming soon):

| üîó Connect via passkey association                                                                   | ‚Ü©Ô∏è Connect via webhooks                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <p><strong>Keep existing authentication flows</strong><br/>Use them in parallel to passkey flows</p> | <p><strong>Full authentication flows</strong> </p><p>Incl. device and user detection</p>           |
| <p><strong>Fully own the auth UX/UI</strong><br/>Only passkey ceremony is added</p>                  | <p><strong>Pre-built, passkey-optimized UX/UI</strong><br/>Customizable web components</p>         |
| <p><strong>Passwords via your current auth</strong><br/>No change in password auth flows or UI</p>   | <p><strong>Passwords via Corbado web component</strong><br/>Authentication leveraging webhooks</p> |
| _Best for fully owning UX / UI in authentication_                                                    | _Best for out-of-the-box passkey-first authentication_                                             |
| [**Start with passkey association**](/products/corbado-connect/connect-via-passkey-association)      | [**Start with webhooks**](/products/corbado-connect/connect-via-webhooks)                          |

In both integration ways, you can:

- continue to offer password-based authentication
- keep existing user data where it is
- gradually and smoothly roll out passkeys to passkey-ready devices and users
