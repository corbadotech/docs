The **short-term** session (represented as **JWT**) has a limited validity period and requires refreshing. To accomplish this, the refresh logic, written in JavaScript, must be integrated into your frontend. The logic consists of two main components: the [session watcher](#session-watcher) and the [refresh routine](#refresh-routine).

## Session watcher&#x20;

The session watcher checks every 200 ms if there exists a **short-term** session (represented as **JWT**) cookie. If so, it starts the [refresh routine](#refresh-routine).

If there is no **short-term** session (represented as **JWT**) cookie present, the session watcher stops a potential running refresh routine (except it is a no Internet connection scenario, then it tries to start the [refresh routine](#refresh-routine) every ten seconds).

## Refresh routine

In order to refresh the **short-term** session (represented as **JWT**), a JavaScript timeout is initialized  that runs out ten seconds before the **JWT** expires. This timeout fetches a new **JWT** from the [Frontend API](/overview/corbado-api-structure/frontend-api). On this fetch, the **long-term** session (represented as session ID with database entry) cookie gets transferred and the refresh routine issues a new **short-term** session (represented as **JWT)** for you.&#x20;

Based on the new expiration time point, the refresh routine starts once again. In case there is no internet connection, it tries every ten seconds to refresh the **short-term** session (represented as **JWT**).
