The combination of a **short-term** session (represented as **JWT**) and a **long-term** session (represented as session ID with database entry) provides a convenient method for revoking sessions.

Revoking a session involves deleting the corresponding **long-term** session entry from the Corbado database. You can accomplish this easily through the developer panel by accessing the [session list](https://app.corbado.com/app/sessions).

<Info>
Technically speaking, the session will persist until the **short-term** session (represented as **JWT**) expires. Thus the revocation/logout will be delayed to a maximum of the **short-term** session (represented as **JWT**) lifetime.
